        "Section 0. Introduction": "\nMargaret, Canovan\n\n\n\n\nWith the creation of man, the principle of beginning came\ninto the world. ... It is in the nature of beginning that some-\nthing new is started which cannot be expected. (Below, p. 177)\n\n\nI\n\nHannah Arendt is preeminently the theorist of beginnings. All\nher books are tales of the unexpected (whether concerned with\nthe novel horrors of totalitarianism or the new dawn of revolu-\ntion), and reflections on the human capacity to start something\nnew pervade her thinking. When she published The Human Con-\ndition in 1958, she herself sent something unexpected out into\nthe world, and forty years later the book's originality is as striking\nas ever. Belonging to no genre, it has had no successful imitators,\nand its style and manner remain highly idiosyncratic. Although\nArendt never tried to gather disciples and found a school of\nthought, she has been a great educator, opening her readers' eyes\nto new ways of looking at the world and at human affairs. Often\nthe way she sheds light into neglected corners of experience is\nby making new distinctions, many of them threefold, as if con-\nventional dichotomies were too constricting for her intellectual\nimagination. The Human Condition is crammed with distinctions:\nbetween labor, work, and action; between power, violence, and\nstrength; between the earth and the world; between property and\nwealth; and many more, often established through etymological\nexplorations. But these distinctions are linked to a more contro-\nversial way of challenging contemporary truisms. For (in what is\nsurely the most unexpected feature of the book) she finds in an-\ncient Greece an Archimedean point from which to cast a critical\n\n[ vd 1\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\neye on ways of thinking and behaving that we take for granted.\nIndeed, her calm assumption that we may be able to learn impor-\ntant lessons from the experience of people who lived two and a\nhalf millennia ago itself challenges the modern belief in progress.\nContinual references to the Greeks have added to the sense of\nbewilderment experienced by many readers of The Human Condi-\ntion , who have found it hard to understand what is actually going\non in the book. Here is a long, complex piece of writing that\nconforms to no established pattern, crammed with unexpected\ninsights but lacking a clearly apparent argumentative structure.\nThe most urgent question to be addressed by way of introduc-\ntion is, therefore, what is Arendt actually doing ?\n\nBoth the book's difficulty and its enduring fascination arise\nfrom the fact that she is doing a great many things at once. There\nare more intertwined strands of thought than can possibly be\nfollowed at first reading, and even repeated readings are liable to\nbring surprises. But one thing she is clearly not doing is writing\npolitical philosophy as conventionally understood: that is to say,\noffering political prescriptions backed up by philosophical argu-\nments. Readers accustomed to that genre have tried to find\nsomething like it in The Human Condition , usually by stressing\nArendt's account of the human capacity for action. Since the\nbook is laced with criticism of modern society, it is tempting to\nsuppose that she intended to present a utopia of political action,\na kind of New Athens. Nor is this caricature entirely without\nfoundation. Arendt was certainly drawn to participatory democ-\nracy, and was an enthusiastic observer of outbreaks of civic activ-\nity ranging from American demonstrations against the Vietnam\nWar to the formation of grassroots citizens' “councils” during\nthe short-lived Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Reminding us\nthat the capacity to act is present even in unlikely circumstances\nwas certainly one of her purposes. But she emphatically denied\nthat her role as a political thinker was to propose a blueprint for\nthe future or to tell anyone what to do. Repudiating the title of\n“political philosopher,” she argued that the mistake made by all\npolitical philosophers since Plato has been to ignore the funda-\nmental condition of politics: that it goes on among plural human\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nbeings, each of whom can act and start something new. The\nresults that emerge from such interaction are contingent and\nunpredictable, “matters of practical politics, subject to the\nagreement of many; they can never lie in theoretical considera-\ntions or the opinion of one person” (p. 5).\n\nNot political philosophy, then; and, indeed, a good deal of the\nbook does not on the face of it appear to be about politics at all.\nThe long analyses of labor and work, and of the implications of\nmodern science and economic growth, are concerned with the\nsetting for politics rather than politics itself. Even the discussion\nof action is only partially related to specifically political acts.\nShortly after the book's publication, Arendt herself described The\nHuman Condition as “a kind of prolegomena” to a more system-\natic work of political theory which she planned (but never com-\npleted). Since “the central political activity is action,” she ex-\nplained, it had been necessary first to carry out a preliminary\nexercise in clarification “to separate action conceptually from\nother human activities with which it is usually confounded, such\nas labor and work.” 1 And indeed the book's most obvious or-\nganizing principle lies in its phenomenological analysis of three\nforms of activity that are fundamental to the human condition:\nlabor, which corresponds to the biological life of man as an ani-\nmal; work, which corresponds to the artificial world of objects\nthat human beings build upon the earth; and action, which corre-\nsponds to our plurality as distinct individuals. Arendt argues that\nthese distinctions (and the hierarchy of activities implicit in\nthem) have been ignored within an intellectual tradition shaped\nby philosophical and religious priorities. However, there is con-\nsiderably more to the book than the phenomenological analysis,\nand more even than Arendt's critique of traditional political phi-\nlosophy's misrepresentation of human activity. For those con-\ncerns are framed by her response to contemporary events. When\nshe says in her prologue that she proposes “nothing more than\n\n\n1 . From a research proposal submitted to the Rockefeller Foundation after\nthe publication of The Human Condition, probably in 1959. Correspondence\nwith the Rockefeller Foundation, Library of Congress MSS Box 20, p. 013872.\n\n\nix\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nto think what we are doing,” she also makes clear that what she\nhas in mind is not just a general analysis of human activity, but\n“a reconsideration of the human condition from the vantage\npoint of our newest experiences and our most recent fears.” What\nexperiences and fears?\n\n\nII\n\nThe prologue opens with reflections on one of those events that\nreveal the human capacity for making new beginnings: the\nlaunch of the first space satellite in 1957, which Arendt describes\nas an “event, second in importance to no other, not even to the\nsplitting of the atom.” Like the Hungarian Revolution of 1956,\nwhich also occurred while she was working on the book, this un-\nexpected event led her to rearrange her ideas, but was at the same\ntime a vindication of observations already made. For, noting that\nthis amazing demonstration of human power was greeted on all\nsides not with pride or awe but rather as a sign that mankind\nmight escape from the earth, she comments that this “rebellion\nagainst human existence as it has been given” had been under\nway for some time. By escaping from the earth into the skies,\nand through enterprises such as nuclear technology, human be-\nings are successfully challenging natural limits, posing political\nquestions made vastly more difficult by the inaccessibility of\nmodern science to public discussion.\n\nArendt's prologue moves from this theme to “another no less\nthreatening event” that seems at first sight strangely unconnec-\nted: the advent of automation. While liberating us from the bur-\nden of hard labor, automation is causing unemployment in a “so-\nciety of laborers” where all occupations are conceived of as ways\nof making a living. Over the course of the book, framing the\nphenomenological analysis of human activities, a dialectical con-\ntrast between these two apparently unrelated topics is gradually\ndeveloped. On the one hand, the dawn of the space age demon-\nstrates that human beings literally transcend nature. As a result\nof modern science's “alienation from the earth? the human ca-\npacity to start new things calls all natural limits into question,\n\n\n1 * 1\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nleaving the future alarmingly open. On the other hand, in a de-\nvelopment Arendt traces to “alienation from the world'' modern,\nautomated societies engrossed by ever more efficient production\nand consumption encourage us to behave and think of ourselves\nsimply as an animal species governed by natural laws.\n\nHuman animals unconscious of their capacities and responsi-\nbilities are not well fitted to take charge of earth-threatening\npowers. This conjunction echoes Arendt's earlier analysis of to-\ntalitarianism as a nihilistic process propelled by a paradoxical\ncombination of convictions: on the one hand the belief that “ev-\nerything is possible,” and on the other that human beings are\nmerely an animal species governed by laws of nature or history,\nin the service of which individuals are entirely dispensable. The\necho is not surprising, for The Human Condition is organically\nlinked to Arendt's work on totalitarianism, and the two together\ncontain an original and striking diagnosis of the contemporary\nhuman predicament.\n\nThe book grew from the Charles R. Walgreen Foundation lec-\ntures which Arendt gave at the University of Chicago in April\n1956, themselves an outgrowth of a much larger project on “To-\ntalitarian Elements in Marxism.” Arendt had embarked on this\nproject after finishing The Origins of Totalitarianism, which con-\ntained a good deal about the antecedents of Nazi anti-Semitism\nand racism, but nothing about the Marxist background to Stalin's\nmurderous version of class struggle. Her new enterprise was to\nconsider what features of Marxist theory might have contributed\nto this disaster. In the event, her trawl brought up so rich and\nvariegated a catch that the Marx book was never written, but\nmany of the trains of thought involved found their way into The\nHuman Condition , notably her conclusion that Marx had fatally\nmisconceived political action in terms of a mixture of the other\nhuman activities she calls work and labor.\n\nTo understand political action as making something is in Ar-\nendt's view a dangerous mistake. Making — the activity she calls\nwork — is something a craftsman does by forcing raw material to\nconform to his model. The raw material has no say in the pro-\ncess, and neither do human beings cast as raw material for an\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nattempt to create a new society or make history . 2 Talk of “Man”\nmaking his own history is misleading, for (as Arendt continually\nreminds us) there is no such person: “men, not Man, live on the\nearth and inhabit the world.” To conceive of politics as making is\nto ignore human plurality in theory and to coerce individuals in\npractice. Nonetheless, Arendt found that Marx had inherited this\nparticular misconception of politics from the great tradition of\nWestern political thought. Ever since Plato turned his back on\nthe Athenian democracy and set out his scheme for an ideal city,\npolitical philosophers had been writing about politics in a way\nthat systematically ignored the most salient political features of\nhuman beings — that they are plural, that each of them is capable\nof new perspectives and new actions, and that they will not fit a\ntidy, predictable model unless these political capacities are\ncrushed. One of Arendt's main purposes in The Human Condition\nis therefore to challenge the entire tradition of political philoso-\nphy by recovering and bringing to light these neglected human\ncapacities.\n\nBut this critique of political philosophy is not the only grand\ntheme in the book that stems from her reflections on Marx. For\nalthough Marx spoke of making, using the terminology of crafts-\nmanship, Arendt claims that he actually understood history in\nterms of processes of production and consumption much closer\nto animal life — labor, in fact. His vision of human history as a\npredictable process is a story not of unique, mortal individuals\nbut of the collective life-process of a species. While he was in\nArendt's view quite wrong to suppose that this process could lead\nthrough revolution to “the realm of freedom,” she was struck by\nhis picture of individuality submerged in the collective life of a\nhuman species, devoted to production and consumption and\nmoving inexorably on its way. She found this a revealing repre-\nsentation of modern society, in which economic concerns have\ncome to dominate both politics and human self-consciousness.\n\n\n2. Arendt's point is illustrated by Mussolini's admiring comment on the Bol-\nshevik revolution, “Lenin is an artist who has worked in men as others have\nworked in marble or metal,” quoted by Alan Bullock in Hitler and Stalin: Parallel\nLives (London: Fontana Press, 1993), page 374.\n\n[ xii ]\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nA second grand theme interwoven with Arendt's phenomenology\nof human activities is therefore her account of the rise of a “la-\nborers' society.”\n\nThis theme of “the social” remains one of the most baffling\nand contentious aspects of the book. Many readers have taken\noffense at Arendt's derogatory references to social concerns, and\nhave also assumed that in criticizing the conformist materialism\nof modern society, Arendt intends to recommend a life of heroic\naction. But that reading misses the book's complexity, for another\nof its central themes concerns the dangers of action, which sets\noff new processes beyond the actors' control, including the very\nprocesses that have given rise to modern society. At the heart of\nher analysis of the human condition is the vital importance for\ncivilized existence of a durable human world, built upon the\nearth to shield us against natural processes and provide a stable\nsetting for our mortal lives. Like a table around which people are\ngathered, that world “relates and separates men at the same time”\n(p. 52). Only the experience of sharing a common human world\nwith others who look at it from different perspectives can enable\nus to see reality in the round and to develop a shared common\nsense. Without it, we are each driven back on our own subjective\nexperience, in which only our feelings, wants, and desires have\nreality.\n\nThe main threat to the human world has for several centuries\nbeen the economic modernization that (as Marx pointed out) de-\nstroyed all stability and set everything in motion. Unlike Marx,\nfor whom this change was part of an inevitable historical process,\nArendt traces it to the unintended effects of contingent human\nactions, notably the massive expropriation of ecclesiastical and\npeasant property carried out in the course of the Reformation.\nFor property (in the sense of rights to land passed down through\nthe generations) had always been the chief bastion of the civilized\nworld, giving owners an interest in maintaining its stability. The\ngreat change set in motion by the expropriations of the sixteenth\ncentury was twofold. For one thing, peasants with a stake in the\nstability of the world were turned into day laborers entirely ab-\nsorbed in the struggle to satisfy their bodily needs. For another,\nstable property was converted into fluid wealth — capital, in\n\n[ xiii ]\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nfact — with the dynamic effects that Marx had described so well.\nInstead of inhabiting a stable world of objects made to last, hu-\nman beings found themselves sucked into an accelerating process\nof production and consumption.\n\nBy the time that Arendt was reflecting on the implications of\nautomation, this process of production and consumption had\ngone far beyond catering for natural needs; indeed the activities,\nmethods, and consumer goods involved were all highly artificial.\nBut she points out that this modern artificiality is quite unlike\nthe stable worldly artifice inhabited by earlier civilizations. Ob-\njects, furniture, houses themselves have become items of con-\nsumption, while automatic production processes have taken on a\nquasi-natural rhythm to which human beings have had to adjust\nthemselves. It is, she says, “as though we had forced open the\ndistinguishing boundaries which protected the world, the human\nartifice, from nature, the biological process which goes on in its\nvery midst as well as the natural cyclical processes which sur-\nround it, delivering and abandoning to them the always threat-\nened stability of a human world” (p. 126). Elsewhere in The Hu-\nman Condition she describes what has happened as an “unnatural\ngrowth of the natural” or a “liberation of the life process,” for\nmodernization has turned out to be extraordinarily good at in-\ncreasing production, consumption, and procreation, giving rise\nto a vastly expanded human race which is producing and con-\nsuming more than ever before. Her contention is that since these\neconomic concerns came to be the center of public attention and\npublic policy (instead of being hidden away in the privacy of the\nhousehold as in all previous civilizations), the costs have been\ndevastation of the world and an ever-increasing tendency for hu-\nman beings to conceive of themselves in terms of their desire\nto consume.\n\nThe implication of her argument is not, however, that all we\nneed to do is to haul ourselves up out of our immersion in labor\nand take action. For this modern hegemony of laboring does not\nmean that human beings have ceased to act, to make new begin-\nnings, or to start new processes — only that science and technol-\nogy have become the arena for “action into nature.” At the very\nsame time when men were becoming more and more inclined to\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nthink of themselves as an animal species, their ability to tran-\nscend such limits was being dramatically revealed by scientific\ninventions. For the counterpart of the “world-alienation” suf-\nfered by laborers was “earth-alienation” among scientists. While\nArchimedes had declared long ago that he would be able to move\nthe earth if he could find a place to stand, Arendt argues that\n(from the time of Galileo to contemporary space engineers and\nnuclear scientists) men have found ways of looking at the earth\nfrom a cosmic perspective, and (exercising the human privilege\nof making new beginnings) have challenged natural limits to the\npoint of threatening the future of life itself. According to her\ndiagnosis of the contemporary predicament, Promethean pow-\ners — releasing processes with unfathomable consequences — are\nbeing exercised in a society of beings too absorbed in consump-\ntion to take any responsibility for the human world or to under-\nstand their political capacities. She observes in her prologue that\n“thoughtlessness” (itself related to the loss of the common hu-\nman world) is “among the outstanding characteristics of our\ntime,” and her object in thinking aloud was surely to encourage\nthought in others.\n\n\nIll\n\nIn so far as Arendt's purpose was to provoke thought and discus-\nsion, she has been resoundingly successful. Like many of her\nwritings, The Human Condition has been the subject of intense\ndebate ever since its appearance. Indeed, few other works of\nmodern political theory have had such a mixed press, regarded\nby some as a work of genius and by others as beneath refutation.\nMany academics have taken exception to the book's unorthodox\nstyle and manner. Paying no attention to mainstream debates,\nArendt sets out her own analysis without defining her terms or\nengaging in conventional argumentation. Political controversies\nhave also raged about the book. Its treatment of the animal la-\nborans and its analysis of social concerns made its author unpopu-\nlar with many on the left, but her account of action brought a\nmessage of hope and encouragement to other radicals, including\nsome in the Civil Rights movement and behind the Iron Curtain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nDuring the students' movement of the 1960s The Human Condi-\ntion was hailed as a textbook of participatory democracy, and as-\nsociation with that movement in turn alienated its critics.\n\nIn recent years, as Arendt's thought has attracted increased at-\ntention (partly for reasons she would not herself have welcomed,\nsuch as interest in her gender, her ethnicity, and her romantic\nrelationship with Heidegger), the book's importance has come to\nbe very widely recognized, but its meaning remains in dispute.\nSuch is the complexity of its interwoven threads that there is\nscope for many different readings. Aristotelians, phenomenolo-\ngists, Habermasians, postmodernists, feminists, and many others\nhave found inspiration in different strands of its rich fabric, and\nthe forty years since its publication are not nearly long enough\nto allow an assessment of its lasting significance. If we can extract\na central theme from so complex a book, that theme must be\nits reminder of the vital importance of politics, and of properly\nunderstanding our political capacities and the dangers and op-\nportunities they offer.\n\nArendt's account of the human condition reminds us that hu-\nman beings are creatures who act in the sense of starting things\nand setting off trains of events. This is something we go on doing\nwhether we understand the implications or not, with the result\nthat both the human world and the earth itself have been devas-\ntated by our self-inflicted catastrophes. Looking at what she calls\n“the modern age” (from the seventeenth to the early twentieth\ncentury), she diagnoses a paradoxical situation in which radical\neconomic processes were set off by human action, while those\nconcerned increasingly thought of themselves as helpless flotsam\non the currents of socioeconomic forces. Both trends, she be-\nlieved, were linked with a new focusing of public attention on\neconomic activities that had traditionally been private matters\nfor the household. In her prologue, however, she observes that\nthis “modern age” of which she writes has itself now passed away,\nfor the advent of nuclear technology has begun a “new and yet\nunknown age” in the long interaction between human beings\nand their natural habitat. If she were alive today, she might point\nto a novel variation on the familiar theme of power and help-\nlessness, again connected with the emergence into the public\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nrealm of a natural function hitherto cloaked in privacy. On the\none hand, the advent of genetic engineering (with its power to\nset off new processes that burst the bonds of nature) strikingly\nconfirms human transcendence and what she called “a rebellion\nagainst human existence as it has been given” (p. 2). On the other\nhand, our self-understanding as animals has deepened into an\nunprecedented stress not just on production but on reproduc-\ntion. Matters of sex, allowed only recently into die public arena,\nseem rapidly to be elbowing other topics out of public discourse,\nwhile neo-Darwinian scientists encourage us to believe that ev-\nerything about us is determined by our genes.\n\nSince the gap between power and responsibility seems wider\nthan ever, her reminder of the human capacity for action and\nher attempt “to think what we are doing” are particularly timely.\nHowever, we need to listen carefully to what she is saying, for we\ncan easily misunderstand her message as a call for humanity to\nrise from its torpor, take charge of events, and consciously make\nour own future. The trouble with that quasi-Marxist scenario is\nthat there is no “humanity” that could take responsibility in this\nway. Human beings are plural and mortal, and it is these features\nof the human condition that give politics both its miraculous\nopenness and its desperate contingency.\n\nThe most heartening message of The Human Condition is its\nreminder of human natality and the miracle of beginning. In\nsharp contrast to Heidegger's stress on our mortality, Arendt ar-\ngues that faith and hope in human affairs come from the fact that\nnew people are continually coming into the world, each of them\nunique, each capable of new initiatives that may interrupt or\ndivert the chains of events set in motion by previous actions.\nShe speaks of action as “the one miracle-working faculty of man”\n(p. 246), pointing out that in human affairs it is actually quite\nreasonable to expect the unexpected, and that new beginnings\ncannot be ruled out even when society seems locked in stagna-\ntion or set on an inexorable course. Since the book's publication,\nher observations on the unpredictability of politics have been\nstrikingly confirmed, not least by the collapse of communism.\nThe revolutions of 1989 were notably Arendtian, illustrating her\naccount of how power can spring up as if from nowhere when\n\n[ xvii ]\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\npeople begin to “act in concert,” and can ebb away unexpectedly\nfrom apparently powerful regimes.\n\nBut if her analysis of action is a message of hope in dark times,\nit also carries warnings. For the other side of that miraculous\nunpredictability of action is lack of control over its effects. Ac-\ntion sets things in motion, and one cannot foresee even the ef-\nfects of one's own initiatives, let alone control what happens\nwhen they are entangled with other people's initiatives in the\npublic arena. Action is therefore deeply frustrating, for its results\ncan turn out to be quite different from what the actor intended.\nIt is because of this “haphazardness” of action amongst plural\nactors that political philosophers ever since Plato have tried to\nsubstitute for action a model of politics as making a work of art.\nFollowing the philosopher-king who sees the ideal model and\nmolds his passive subjects to fit it, scheme after scheme has been\nelaborated for perfect societies in which everyone conforms to\nthe author's blueprint. The curious sterility of utopias comes\nfrom the absence within them of any scope for initiative, any\nroom for plurality. Although it is now forty years since Arendt\nmade this point, mainstream political philosophy is still caught\nin the same trap, still unwilling to take action and plurality seri-\nously, still searching for theoretical principles so rationally com-\npelling that even generations yet unborn must accept them, thus\nmaking redundant the haphazard contingency of accommoda-\ntions reached in actual political arenas.\n\nArendt observes that there are some remedies for the predic-\naments of action, but she stresses their limited reach. One is\nsimply the permanent possibility of taking further action to in-\nterrupt apparently inexorable processes or set politics off on a\ndifferent direction, but that in itself does nothing to cure the\ndamage of the past or make safe the unpredictable future. Only\nthe human capacities to forgive and to promise can deal with\nthese problems, and then only in part. Faced (as so many con-\ntemporary polities are) with the wearisome sequence of revenge\nfor past wrongs that only provokes further revenge, forgiveness\ncan break that chain, and recent efforts at reconciliation between\nthe races in South Africa offer an impressive illustration of Ar-\nendt's point. As she notes, however, no one can forgive himself:\n\n[ xviii ]\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nonly the unpredictable cooperation of others can do that, and\nsome evils are beyond forgiveness. Furthermore, this way of\nbreaking the chain of consequences set off by action works only\nfor human consequences; there is no remedy through forgiveness\nfor the “action into nature” that sets off nuclear reaction or\ncauses the extinction of species.\n\nAnother way of coping with the unpredictable consequences\nof plural initiatives is the human capacity to make and keep\npromises. Promises made to oneself have no reliability, but when\nplural persons come together to bind themselves for the future,\nthe covenants they create among themselves can throw “islands\nof predictability” into the “ocean of uncertainty,” creating a new\nkind of assurance and enabling them to exercise power collec-\ntively. Contracts, treaties, and constitutions are all of this kind;\nthey may be enormously strong and reliable, like the U.S. Con-\nstitution, or (like Hitler's Munich agreement) they may be not\nworth the paper they are written on. In other words they are\nutterly contingent, quite unlike the hypothetical agreements\nreached in philosophers' imaginations.\n\nArendt is well known for her celebration of action, particularly\nfor the passages where she talks about the immortal fame earned\nby Athenian citizens when they engaged with their peers in the\npublic realm. But The Hum, an Condition is just as much concerned\nwith action's dangers, and with the myriad processes set off by\nhuman initiative and now raging out of control. She reminds us,\nof course, that we are not helpless animals: we can engage in\nfurther action, take initiatives to interrupt such processes, and\ntry to bring them under control through agreements. But apart\nfrom the physical difficulties of gaining control over processes\nthoughtlessly set off by action into nature, she also reminds us of\nthe political problems caused by plurality itself. In principle, if\nwe can all agree to work together we can exercise great power;\nbut agreement between plural persons is hard to achieve, and\nnever safe from the disruptive initiatives of further actors.\n\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, the one\nsafe prediction we can make is that, despite the continuation of\nprocesses already in motion, the open future will become an\narena for countless human initiatives that are beyond our present\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nimagination. Perhaps it is not too rash to make another predic-\ntion: that future readers will find food for thought and scope for\ndebate in The Human Condition , picking up and developing dif-\nferent strands and themes in this extraordinary book. That would\nhave suited Arendt very well. As she said toward the end of her\nlife,\n\nEach time you write something and you send it out into the\nworld and it becomes public, obviously everybody is free to\ndo with it what he pleases, and this is as it should be. I do\nnot have any quarrel with this. You should not try to hold\nyour hand now on whatever may happen to what you have\nbeen thinking for yourself. You should rather try to learn\nfrom what other people do with it . 3\n\n3. Remarks to the American Society of Christian Ethics, 1973. Library of\nCongress MSS Box 70, p. 011828.\n\n\n[ xx ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrologue\n\n\n\n\nIn 1957, an earth-born object made by man was launched into\nthe universe, where for some weeks it circled the earth according\nto the same laws of gravitation that swing and keep in motion the\ncelestial bodies — the sun, the moon, and the stars. To be sure, the\nman-made satellite was no moon or star, no heavenly body which\ncould follow its circling path for a time span that to us mortals,\nbound by earthly time, lasts from eternity to eternity. Yet, for a\ntime it managed to stay in the skies; it dwelt and moved in the\nproximity of the heavenly bodies as though it had been admitted\ntentatively to their sublime company.\n\nThis event, second in importance to no other, not even to the\nsplitting of the atom, would have been greeted with unmitigated\njoy if it had not been for the uncomfortable military and political\ncircumstances attending it. But, curiously enough, this joy was not\ntriumphal; it was not pride or awe at the tremendousness of human\npower and mastery which filled the hearts of men, who now, when\nthey looked up from the earth toward the skies, could behold there\na thing of their own making. The immediate reaction, expressed\non the spur of the moment, was relief about the first “step toward\nescape from men's imprisonment to the earth.” And this strange\nstatement, far from being the accidental slip of some American re-\nporter, unwittingly echoed the extraordinary line which, more\nthan twenty years ago, had been carved on the funeral obelisk for\none of Russia's great scientists: “Mankind will not remain bound\nto the earth forever.”\n\nSuch feelings have been commonplace for some time. They show\nthat men everywhere are by no means slow to catch up and adjust\nto scientific discoveries and technical developments, but that, on\nthe contrary, they have outsped them by decades. Here, as in other\n\n[ l ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nrespects, science has realized and affirmed what men anticipated\nin dreams that were neither wild nor idle. What is new is only\nthat one of this country's most respectable newspapers finally\nbrought to its front page what up to then had been buried in the\nhighly non-respectable literature of science fiction (to which, un-\nfortunately, nobody yet has paid the attention it deserves as a\nvehicle of mass sentiments and mass desires) . The banality of the\nstatement should not make us overlook how extraordinary in fact\nit was; for although Christians have spoken of the earth as a vale\nof tears and philosophers have looked upon their body as a prison\nof mind or soul, nobody in the history of mankind has ever con-\nceived of the earth as a prison for men's bodies or shown such\neagerness to go literally from here to the moon. Should the emanci-\npation and secularization of the modern age, which began with a\nturning-away, not necessarily from God, but from a god who was\nthe Father of men in heaven, end with an even more fateful repudi-\nation of an Earth who was the Mother of all living creatures under\nthe sky?\n\nThe earth is the very quintessence of the human condition, and\nearthly nature, for all we know, may be unique in the universe\nin providing human beings with a habitat in which they can move\nand breathe without effort and without artifice. The human artifice\nof the world separates human existence from all mere animal en-\nvironment, but life itself is outside this artificial world, and through\nlife man remains related to all other living organisms. For some\ntime now, a great many scientific endeavors have been directed\ntoward making life also “artificial,” toward cutting the last tie\nthrough which even man belongs among the children of nature.\nIt is the same desire to escape from imprisonment to the earth that\nis manifest in the attempt to create life in the test tube, in the de-\nsire to mix “frozen germ plasm from people of demonstrated\nability under the microscope to produce superior human beings”\nand “to alter [their] size, shape and function”; and the wish to\nescape the human condition, I suspect, also underlies the hope to\nextend man's life-span far beyond the hundred-year limit.\n\nThis future man, whom the scientists tell us they will produce\nin no more than a hundred years, seems to be possessed by a rebel-\nlion against human existence as it has been given, a free gift from\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n\nnowhere (secularly speaking), which he wishes to exchange, as it\nwere, for something he has made himself. There is no reason to\ndoubt our abilities to accomplish such an exchange, just as there\nis no reason to doubt our present ability to destroy all organic life\non earth. The question is only whether we wish to use our new\nscientific and technical knowledge in this direction, and this ques-\ntion cannot be decided by scientific means; it is a political question\nof the first order and therefore can hardly be left to the decision of\nprofessional scientists or professional politicians.\n\nWhile such possibilities still may lie in a distant future, the first\nboomerang effects of science's great triumphs have made them-\nselves felt in a crisis within the natural sciences themselves. The\ntrouble concerns the fact that the “truths” of the modern scientific\nworld view, though they can be demonstrated in mathematical\nformulas and proved technologically, will no longer lend them-\nselves to normal expression in speech and thought. The moment\nthese “truths” are spoken of conceptually and coherently, the re-\nsulting statements will be “not perhaps as meaningless as a ‘tri-\nangular circle,' but much more so than a ‘winged lion' ” (Erwin\nSchrodinger) . We do not yet know whether this situation is final.\nBut it could be that we, who are earth-bound creatures and have\nbegun to act as though we were dwellers of the universe, will for-\never be unable to understand, that is, to think and speak about the\nthings which nevertheless we are able to do. In this case, it would\nbe as though our brain, which constitutes the physical, material\ncondition of our thoughts, were unable to follow what we do, so\nthat from now on we would indeed need artificial machines to do\nour thinking and speaking. If it should turn out to be true that\nknowledge (in the modern sense of know-how) and thought have\nparted company for good, then we would indeed become the help-\nless slaves, not so much of our machines as of our know-how,\nthoughtless creatures at the mercy of every gadget which is tech-\nnically possible, no matter how murderous it is.\n\nHowever, even apart from these last and yet uncertain conse-\nquences, the situation created by the sciences is of great political\nsignificance. Wherever the relevance of speech is at stake, matters\nbecome political by definition, for speech is what makes man a\npolitical being. If we would follow the advice, so frequently urged\n\n[ ^ ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nupon us, to adjust our cultural attitudes to the present status of\nscientific achievement, we would in all earnest adopt a way of\nlife in which speech is no longer meaningful. For the sciences today\nhave been forced to adopt a “language” of mathematical symbols\nwhich, though it was originally meant only as an abbreviation for\nspoken statements, now contains statements that in no way can be\ntranslated back into speech. The reason why it may be wise to\ndistrust the political judgment of scientists qua scientists is not\nprimarily their lack of “character” — that they did not refuse to\ndevelop atomic weapons — or their naivete — that they did not\nunderstand that once these weapons were developed they would\nbe the last to be consulted about their use- — but precisely the fact\nthat they move in a world where speech has lost its power. And\nwhatever men do or know or experience can make sense only to\nthe extent that it can be spoken about. There may be truths be-\nyond speech, and they may be of great relevance to man in the\nsingular, that is, to man in so far as he is not a political being,\nwhatever else he may be. Men in the plural, that is, men in so far\nas they live and move and act in this world, can experience mean-\ningfulness only because they can talk with and make sense to each\nother and to themselves.\n\nCloser at hand and perhaps equally decisive is another no less\nthreatening event. This is the advent of automation, which in a\nfew decades probably will empty the factories and liberate man-\nkind from its oldest and most natural burden, the burden of labor-\ning and the bondage to necessity. Here, too, a fundamental aspect\nof the human condition is at stake, but the rebellion against it, the\nwish to be liberated from labor's “toil and trouble,” is not modern\nbut as old as recorded history. Freedom from labor itself is not\nnew; it once belonged among the most firmly established privileges\nof the few. In this instance, it seems as though scientific progress\nand technical developments had been only taken advantage of to\nachieve something about which all former ages dreamed but which\nnone had been able to realize.\n\nHowever, this is so only in appearance. The modern age has\ncarried with it a theoretical glorification of labor and has resulted\nin a factual transformation of the whole of society into a laboring\nsociety. The fulfilment of the wish, therefore, like the fulfilment\n\n[ 4 ]\n\n\n\nPrologue\n\n\nof wishes in fairy tales, comes at a moment when it can only be\nself-defeating. It is a society of laborers which is about to be liber-\nated from the fetters of labor, and this society does no longer know\nof those other higher and more meaningful activities for the sake\nof which this freedom would deserve to be won. Within this so-\nciety, which is egalitarian because this is labor's way of making\nmen live together, there is no class left, no aristocracy of either a\npolitical or spiritual nature from which a restoration of the other\ncapacities of man could start anew. Even presidents, kings, and\nprime ministers think of their offices in terms of a job necessary\nfor the life of society, and among the intellectuals, only solitary\nindividuals are left who consider what they are doing in terms of\nwork and not in terms of making a living. What we are confronted\nwith is the prospect of a society of laborers without labor, that is,\nwithout the only activity left to them. Surely, nothing could be\nworse.\n\nTo these preoccupations and perplexities, this book does not\noffer an answer. Such answers are given every day, and they are\nmatters of practical politics, subject to the agreement of many;\nthey can never lie in theoretical considerations or the opinion of\none person, as though we dealt here with problems for which only\none solution is possible. What I propose in the following is a re-\nconsideration of the human condition from the vantage point of\nour newest experiences and our most recent fears. This, obviously,\nis a matter of thought, and thoughtlessness — the heedless reckless-\nness or hopeless confusion or complacent repetition of “truths”\nwhich have become trivial and empty — seems to me among the\noutstanding characteristics of our time. What I propose, therefore,\nis very simple: it is nothing more than to think what we are doing.\n\n“What we are doing” is indeed the central theme of this book.\nIt deals only with the most elementary articulations of the human\ncondition, with those activities that traditionally, as well as ac-\ncording to current opinion, are within the range of every human\nbeing. For this and other reasons, the highest and perhaps purest\nactivity of which men are capable, the activity of thinking, is left\nout of these present considerations. Systematically, therefore, the\nbook is limited to a discussion of labor, work, and action, which\nforms its three central chapters. Historically, I deal in a last chap-\n\n[ S 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nter with the modern age, and throughout the book with the various\nconstellations within the hierarchy of activities as we know them\nfrom Western history.\n\nHowever, the modern age is not the same as the modern world.\nScientifically, the modern age which began in the seventeenth cen-\ntury came to an end at the beginning of the twentieth century;\npolitically, the modern world, in which we live today, was born\nwith the first atomic explosions. I do not discuss this modern\nworld, against whose background this book was written. I confine\nmyself, on the one hand, to an analysis of those general human\ncapacities which grow out of the human condition and are perma-\nnent, that is, which cannot be irretrievably lost so long as the hu-\nman condition itself is not changed. The purpose of the historical\nanalysis, on the other hand, is to trace back modern world aliena-\ntion, its twofold flight from the earth into the universe and from\nthe world into the self, to its origins, in order to arrive at an un-\nderstanding of the nature of society as it had developed and pre-\nsented itself at the very moment when it was overcome by the\nadvent of a new and yet unknown age.\n\n\n"

    "CHAPTER 1. The Human Condition": {
        "Section 1. Vita Activa and the HUMAN CONDITION": "\nWith the term vita activa , I propose to designate three fundamental\nhuman activities: labor, work, and action. They are fundamental\nbecause each corresponds to one of the basic conditions under\nwhich life on earth has been given to man.\n\nLabor is the activity which corresponds to the biological process\nof the human body, whose spontaneous growth, metabolism, and\neventual decay are bound to the vital necessities produced and fed\ninto the life process by labor. The human condition of labor is life\nitself.\n\nWork is the activity which corresponds to the unnaturalness of\nhuman existence, which is not imbedded in, and whose mortality\nis not compensated by, the species' ever-recurring life cycle. Work\nprovides an “artificial” world of things, distinctly different from\nall natural surroundings. Within its borders each individual life is\nhoused, while this world itself is meant to outlast and transcend\nthem all. The human condition of work is worldliness.\n\nAction, the only activity that goes on directly between men\nwithout the intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the\nhuman condition of plurality, to the fact that men, not Man, live\non the earth and inhabit the world. While all aspects of the hu-\nman condition are somehow related to politics, this plurality is\nspecifically the condition- — not only the conditio sine qua non , but\nthe conditio per quam — of all political life. Thus the language of the\nRomans, perhaps the most political people we have known, used\nthe words “to live” and “to be among men” {inter homines esse )\n\n[ 7 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nor “to die” and “to cease to be among men” (inter homines esse de-\nsinere) as synonyms. But in its most elementary form, the human\ncondition of action is implicit even in Genesis (“Male and female\ncreated He them ”), if we understand that this story of man's crea-\ntion is distinguished in principle from the one according to which\nGod originally created Man ( adam ), “him” and not “them,” so\nthat the multitude of human beings becomes the result of multipli-\ncation . 1 Action would be an unnecessary luxury, a capricious in-\nterference with general laws of behavior, if men were endlessly\nreproducible repetitions of the same model, whose nature or es-\nsence was the same for all and as predictable as the nature or\nessence of any other thing. Plurality is the condition of human\naction because we are all the same, that is, human, in such a way\nthat nobody is ever the same as anyone else who ever lived, lives,\nor will live.\n\nAll three activities and their corresponding conditions are inti-\nmately connected with the most general condition of human exist-\nence: birth and death, natality and mortality. Labor assures not\nonly individual survival, but the life of the species. Work and its\nproduct, the human artifact, bestow a measure of permanence and\ndurability upon the futility of mortal life and the fleeting character\nof human time. Action, in so far as it engages in founding and pre-\n\n1 . In the analysis of postclassical political thought, it is often quite illuminat-\ning to find out which of the two biblical versions of the creation story is cited.\nThus it is highly characteristic of the difference between the teaching of Jesus\nof Nazareth and of Paul that Jesus, discussing the relationship between man and\nwife, refers to Genesis 1:27: “Have ye not read, that he which made them at the\nbeginning made them male and female” (Matt. 19:4), whereas Paul on a similar\noccasion insists that the woman was created “of the man” and hence “for the\nman,” even though he then somewhat attenuates the dependence: “neither is the\nman without the woman, neither the woman without the man” (I Cor. 11:8-12).\nThe difference indicates much more than a different attitude to the role of woman.\nFor Jesus, faith was closely related to action (cf. § 3 3 below) ; for Paul, faith was\nprimarily related to salvation. Especially interesting in this respect is Augustine\n( De civitate Dei xii. 21), who not only ignores Genesis 1:27 altogether but sees\nthe difference between man and animal in that man was created umm ac singu-\nlum, whereas all animals were ordered “to come into being several at once”\n(plum simul iussit exsistere) . To Augustine, the creation story offers a welcome\nopportunity to stress the species character of animal life as distinguished from the\nsingularity of human existence.\n\n\n[ 8 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nserving political bodies, creates the condition for remembrance,\nthat is, for history. Labor and work, as well as action, are also\nrooted in natality in so far as they have the task to provide and pre-\nserve the world for, to foresee and reckon with, the constant in-\nflux of newcomers who are bom into the world as strangers. How-\never, of the three, action has the closest connection with the hu-\nman condition of natality; the new beginning inherent in birth can\nmake itself felt in the world only because the newcomer possesses\nthe capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting. In\nthis sense of initiative, an element of action, and therefore of\nnatality, is inherent in all human activities. Moreover, since action\nis the political activity par excellence, natality, and not mortality,\nmay be the central category of political, as distinguished from\nmetaphysical, thought.\n\nThe human condition comprehends more than the conditions\nunder which life has been given to man. Men are conditioned\nbeings because everything they come in contact with turns imme-\ndiately into a condition of their existence. The world in which the\nvita activa spends itself consists of things produced by human ac-\ntivities; but the things that owe their existence exclusively to men\nnevertheless constantly condition their human makers. In addition\nto the conditions under which life is given to man on earth, and\npartly out of them, men constantly create their own, self-made\nconditions, which, their human origin and their variability not-\nwithstanding, possess the same conditioning power as natural\nthings. Whatever touches or enters into a sustained relationship\nwith human life immediately assumes the character of a condition\nof human existence. This is why men, no matter what they do, are\nalways conditioned beings. Whatever enters the human world of\nits own accord or is drawn into it by human effort becomes part\nof the human condition. The impact of the world's reality upon\nhuman existence is felt and received as a conditioning force. The\nobjectivity of the world — its object- or thing-character— and the\nhuman condition supplement each other; because human existence\nis conditioned existence, it would be impossible without things,\nand things would be a heap of unrelated articles, a non-world, if\nthey were not the conditioners of human existence.\n\nTo avoid misunderstanding: the human condition is not the\n\n[ 9 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nsame as human nature, and the sum total of human activities and\ncapabilities which correspond to the human condition does not con-\nstitute anything like human nature. For neither those we discuss\nhere nor those we leave out, like thought and reason, and not even\nthe most meticulous enumeration of them all, constitute essential\ncharacteristics of human existence in the sense that without them\nthis existence would no longer be human. The most radical change\nin the human condition we can imagine would be an emigration of\nmen from the earth to some other planet. Such an event, no longer\ntotally impossible, would imply that man would have to live under\nman-made conditions, radically different from those the earth\noffers him. Neither labor nor work nor action nor, indeed, thought\nas we know it would then make sense any longer. Yet even these\nhypothetical wanderers from the earth would still be human; but\nthe only statement we could make regarding their “nature” is that\nthey still are conditioned beings, even though their condition is\nnow self-made to a considerable extent.\n\nThe problem of human nature, the Augustinian quaestio mihi\nf actus sum (“a question have I become for myself'), seems un-\nanswerable in both its individual psychological sense and its gen-\neral philosophical sense. It is highly unlikely that we, who can\nknow, determine, and define the natural essences of all things sur-\nrounding us, which we are not, should ever be able to do the same\nfor ourselves — this would be like jumping over our own shadows.\nMoreover, nothing entitles us to assume that man has a nature or\nessence in the same sense as other things. In other words, if we\nhave a nature or essence, then surely only a god could know and\ndefine it, and the first prerequisite would be that he be able to\nspeak about a “who” as though it were a “what .” 2 The perplexity\n\n2. Augustine, who is usually credited with having been the first to raise the\nso-called anthropological question in philosophy, knew this quite well. He dis-\ntinguishes between the questions of “Who am I?” and “What am I?” the first\nbeing directed by man at himself (“And I directed myself at myself and said to\nme: You, who are you? And I answered: A man” — tu , quis es? [Confessiones x. 6])\nand the second being addressed to God (“What then am I, my God? What is\nmy nature?” — Quid ergo sum, Deus meus? Quae natura sum? [x. 17]). For in the\n“great mystery,” the grande profundum, which man is (iv. 14), there is “some-\nthing of man [aliquid hominis ] which the spirit of man which is in him itself\n\n\n[ 10 }\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nis that the modes of human cognition applicable to things with\n“natural” qualities, including ourselves to the limited extent that\nwe are specimens of the most highly developed species of organic\nlife, fail us when we raise the question: And who are we? This is\nwhy attempts to define human nature almost invariably end with\nsome construction of a deity, that is, with the god of the philoso-\nphers, who, since Plato, has revealed himself upon closer inspec-\ntion to be a kind of Platonic idea of man. Of course, to demask such\nphilosophic concepts of the divine as conceptualizations of human\ncapabilities and qualities is not a demonstration of, not even an\nargument for, the non-existence of God; but the fact that attempts\nto define the nature of man lead so easily into an idea which defi-\nnitely strikes us as “superhuman” and therefore is identified with\nthe divine may cast suspicion upon the very concept of “human\nnature.”\n\nOn the other hand, the conditions of human existence — life it-\nself, natality and mortality, worldliness, plurality, and the earth-\ncan never “explain” what we are or answer the question of who\nwe are for the simple reason that they never condition us absolute-\nly. This has always been the opinion of philosophy, in distinction\nfrom the sciences — anthropology, psychology, biology, etc. —\nwhich also concern themselves with man. But today we may al-\nmost say that we have demonstrated even scientifically that,\nthough we live now, and probably always will, under the earth's\nconditions, we are not mere earth-bound creatures. Modern nat-\nural science owes its great triumphs to having looked upon and\ntreated earth-bound nature from a truly universal viewpoint, that\nis, from an Archimedean standpoint taken, wilfully and explicitly,\noutside the earth.\n\n\nknoweth not. But Thou, Lord, who has made him f fecisti eum\\ knowest every-\nthing of him [eius omnia]” (x. 5). Thus, the most familiar of these phrases which\nI quoted in the text, the qmestio mihif actus sum, is a question raised in the pres-\nence of God, “in whose eyes I have become a question for myself” (x. 33). In\nbrief, the answer to the question “Who am I?” is simply: “You are a man —\nwhatever that may be”; and the answer to the question “What am I?” can be\ngiven only by God who made man. The question about the nature of man is no\nless a theological question than the question about the jnature of God; both can\nbe settled only within the framework of a divinely revealed answer.\n\n[ n ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n",
        "Section 2. The term Vita Activa": "\nThe term vita activa is loaded and overloaded with tradition. It is\nas old as (but not older than) our tradition of political thought.\nAnd this tradition, far from comprehending and conceptualizing\nall the political experiences of Western mankind, grew out of a\nspecific historical constellation: the trial of Socrates and the con-\nflict between the philosopher and the polls. It eliminated many ex-\nperiences of an earlier past that were irrelevant to its immediate\npolitical purposes and proceeded until its end, in the work of Karl\nMarx, in a highly selective manner. The term itself, in medieval\nphilosophy the standard translation of the Aristotelian bios politi-\nkos, already occurs in Augustine, where, as vita negotiosa or actuosa,\nit still reflects its original meaning: a life devoted to public-political\nmatters . 3\n\nAristotle distinguished three ways of life ( bioi ) which men\nmight choose in freedom, that is, in full independence of the neces-\nsities of life and the relationships they originated. This prerequisite\nof freedom ruled out all ways of life chiefly devoted to keeping\none's self alive — not only labor, which was the way of life of the\nslave, who was coerced by the necessity to stay alive and by the\nrule of his master, but also the working life of the free craftsman\nand the acquisitive life of the merchant. In short, it excluded every-\nbody who involuntarily or voluntarily, for his whole life or tem-\nporarily, had lost the free disposition of his movements and ac-\ntivities . 4 The remaining three ways of life have in common that\n\n3. See Augustine De civitate Dei xix. 2, 19.\n\n4. William L. Westermann (“Between Slavery and Freedom,” American\nHistorical Review, Vol. L [1945]) holds that the “statement of Aristotle . . . that\ncraftsmen live in a condition of limited slavery meant that the artisan, when he\nmade a work contract, disposed of two of the four elements of his free status\n[viz., of freedom of economic activity and right of unrestricted movement], but\nby his own volition and for a temporary period”; evidence quoted by Wester-\nmann shows that freedom was then understood to consist of “status, personal in-\nviolability, freedom of economic activity, right of unrestricted movement,” and\nslavery consequently “was the lack of these four attributes.” Aristotle, in his\nenumeration of “ways of life” in the Nicomachean Ethics (i. 5) and the Eudemian\nEthics (1215a35 ff.), does not even mention a craftsman's way of life; to him it\n\n[ 12 }\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthey were concerned with the “beautiful,” that is, with things\nneither necessary nor merely useful: the life of enjoying bodily\npleasures in which the beautiful, as it is given, is consumed;\nthe life devoted to the matters of the polls, in which excellence pro-\nduces beautiful deeds; and the life of the philosopher devoted to\ninquiry into, and contemplation of, things eternal, whose ever-\nlasting beauty can neither be brought about through the producing\ninterference of man nor be changed through his consumption of\nthem . 8\n\nThe chief difference between the Aristotelian and the later me-\ndieval use of the term is that the bios politikos denoted explicitly\nonly the realm of human affairs, stressing the action, praxis , needed\nto establish and sustain it. Neither labor nor work was considered\nto possess sufficient dignity to constitute a bios at all, an autono-\nmous and authentically human way of life; since they served and\nproduced what was necessary and useful, they could not be free, in-\ndependent of human needs and wants . 6 That the political way of\nlife escaped this verdict is due to the Greek understanding of polls\nlife, which to them denoted a very special and freely chosen form\nof political organization and by no means just any form of action\nnecessary to keep men together in an orderly fashion. Not that\nthe Greeks or Aristotle were ignorant of the fact that human life\nalways demands some form of political organization and that rul-\ning over subjects might constitute a distinct way of life; but the\ndespot's way of life, because it was “merely” a necessity, could\nnot be considered free and had no relationship with the bios\npolitikos .' 1\n\nis obvious that a bamusos is not free (cf. Politics 133 7b5) . He mentions, however,\n“the life of money-making” and rejects it because it too is “undertaken under\ncompulsion” ( Nic . Eth. 1096a5). That the criterion is freedom is stressed in the\nEudemian Ethics: he enumerates only those lives that are chosen ep' cxousian.\n\n5. For the opposition of the beautiful to the necessary and the useful see Poli-\ntics 1333a30 ff., 1332b32.\n\n6. For the opposition of the free to the necessary and the useful see ibid.\n1332b2,\n\n7. See ibid. 1277b8 for the distinction between despotic rule and politics. For\nthe argument that the life of the despot is not equal to the life of a free man be-\ncause the former is concerned with “necessary things,” see ibid. 1325a24.\n\n[ 13 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nWith the disappearance of the ancient city-state— Augustine\nseems to have been the last to know at least what it once meant\nto be a citizen — the term vita activa lost its specifically political\nmeaning and denoted all kinds of active engagement in the things of\nthis world. To be sure, it does not follow that work and labor had\nrisen in the hierarchy of human activities and were now equal in\ndignity with a life devoted to politics . 8 It was, rather, the other\nway round: action was now also reckoned among the necessities\nof earthly life, so that contemplation (the bios theoretikos , trans-\nlated into the vita contemplativa ) was left as the only truly free way\nof life . 9\n\nHowever, the enormous superiority of contemplation over ac-\ntivity of any kind, action not excluded, is not Christian in origin.\nWe find it in Plato's political philosophy, where the whole utopian\nreorganization of polis life is not only directed by the superior in-\nsight of the philosopher but has no aim other than to make possible\nthe philosopher's way of life. Aristotle's very articulation of the\ndifferent ways of life, in whose order the life of pleasure plays a\nminor role, is clearly guided by the ideal of contemplation ( theoria ) .\nTo the ancient freedom from the necessities of life and from com-\npulsion by others, the philosophers added freedom and surcease\nfrom political activity ( skhole ), 10 so that the later Christian claim\nto be free from entanglement in worldly affairs, from all the busi-\n\n8. On the widespread opinion that the modem estimate of labor is Christian\nin origin, see below, § 44.\n\n9. See Aquinas Summa theologica ii. 2. 179, esp. art. 2, where the vita activa\narises out of the necessitas vitae praesentis, and Expositio in Psabnos 4J.3, where\nthe body politic is assigned the task of finding all that is necessary for life: in\ncivitate oportet invenire omnia necessaria ad vitam.\n\n10. The Greek word skhole, like the Latin otium, means primarily freedom from\npolitical activity and not simply leisure time, although both words are also used\nto indicate freedom from labor and life's necessities. In any event, they always\nindicate a condition free from worries and cares. An excellent description of the\neveryday life of an ordinary Athenian citizen, who enjoys full freedom from\nlabor and work, can be found in Fustel de Coulanges, The Ancient City (Anchor\ned.; 1956), pp. 334-36; it will convince everybody how time-consuming politi-\ncal activity was under the conditions of the city-state. One can easily guess how\nfull of worry this ordinary political life was if one remembers that Athenian law\ndid not permit remaining neutral and punished those who did not want to take\nsides in factional strife with loss of citizenship.\n\n[ M ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nness of this world, was preceded by and originated in the philo-\nsophic apolitia of late antiquity. What had been demanded only\nby the few was now considered to be a right of all.\n\nThe term vita activa, comprehending all human activities and de-\nfined from the viewpoint of the absolute quiet of contemplation,\ntherefore corresponds more closely to the Greek askholia (“un-\nquiet”), with which Aristotle designated all activity, than to the\nGreek bios politikos. As early as Aristotle the distinction between\nquiet and unquiet, between an almost breathless abstention from\nexternal physical movement and activity of every kind, is more\ndecisive than the distinction between the political and the theoreti-\ncal way of life, because it can eventually be found within each of\nthe three ways of life. It is like the distinction between war and\npeace: just as war takes place for the sake of peace, thus every\nkind of activity, even the processes of mere thought, must cul-\nminate in the absolute quiet of contemplation . 11 Every movement,\nthe movements of body and soul as well as of speech and reason-\ning, must cease before truth. Truth, be it the ancient truth of Being\nor the Christian truth of the living God, can reveal itself only in\ncomplete human stillness . 12\n\nTraditionally and up to the beginning of the modern age, the\nterm vita activa never lost its negative connotation of “un-quiet,”\nnec-otium , a-skholia. As such it remained intimately related to the\neven more fundamental Greek distinction between things that are\nby themselves whatever they are and things which owe their exist-\nence to man, between things that are physei and things that are\nnomd. The primacy of contemplation over activity rests on the con-\nviction that no work of human hands can equal in beauty and truth\nthe physical kosmos , which swings in itself in changeless eternity\nwithout any interference or assistance from outside, from man or\ngod. This eternity discloses itself to mortal eyes only when all\nhuman movements and activities are at perfect rest. Compared\nwith this attitude of quiet, all distinctions and articulations within\n\n11. See Aristotle Politics 1333a30-33. Aquinas defines contemplation as quies\nab exterioribus motibus ( Summa theologica ii. 2. 179. 1).\n\n12. Aquinas stresses the stillness of the soul and recommends the vita activa\nbecause it exhausts and therefore “quietens interior passions” and prepares for\ncontemplation ( Summa theologica ii. 2. 182. 3).\n\n[ 15 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe vita activa disappear. Seen from the viewpoint of contemplation,\nit does not matter what disturbs the necessary quiet, as long as it\nis disturbed.\n\nTraditionally, therefore, the term vita activa receives its meaning\nfrom the vita contemplativa ; its very restricted dignity is bestowed\nupon it because it serves the needs and wants of contemplation in\na living body . 13 Christianity, with its belief in a hereafter whose\njoys announce themselves in the delights of contemplation , 14 con-\nferred a religious sanction upon the abasement of the vita activa to\nits derivative, secondary position; but the determination of the\norder itself coincided with the very discovery of contemplation\n(theoria) as a human faculty, distinctly different from thought\nand reasoning, which occurred in the Socratic school and from\nthen on has ruled metaphysical and political thought throughout\nour tradition . 16 It seems unnecessary to my present purpose to\ndiscuss the reasons for this tradition. Obviously they are deeper\nthan the historical occasion which gave rise to the conflict between\nthe polls and the philosopher and thereby, almost incidentally, also\nled to the discovery of contemplation as the philosopher's way of\nlife. They must lie in an altogether different aspect of the human\ncondition, whose diversity is not exhausted in the various articula-\ntions of the vita activa and, we may suspect, would not be exhausted\neven if thought and the movement of reasoning were included in it.\n\nIf, therefore, the use of the term vita activa , as I propose it here,\n\n13. Aquinas is quite explicit on the connection between the vita activa and the\nwants and needs of the human body which men and animals have in common\n(Sitmma theologica ii. 2. 182. 1).\n\n14. Augustine speaks of the “burden” ( sarcim ) of active life imposed by the\nduty of charity, which would be unbearable without the “sweetness” ( suavitas )\nand the “delight of truth” given in contemplation ( De civitate Dei xix. 19).\n\n15. The time-honored resentment of the philosopher against the human condi-\ntion of having a body is not identical with the ancient contempt for the necessities\nof life; to be subject to necessity was only one aspect of bodily existence, and the\nbody, once freed of this necessity, was capable of that pure appearance the Greeks\ncalled beauty. The philosophers since Plato added to the resentment of being\nforced by bodily wants the resentment of movement of any kind. It is because\nthe philosopher lives in complete quiet that it is only his body which, according\nto Plato, inhabits the city. Here lies also the origin of the early reproach of busy-\nbodiness ( polypragmosyne ) leveled against those who spent their lives in politics.\n\n[ 16 ]\n\n\nis in manifest contradiction to the tradition, it is because I doubt\nnot the validity of the experience underlying the distinction but\nrather the hierarchical order inherent in it from its inception. This\ndoes not mean that I wish to contest or even to discuss, for that\nmatter, the traditional concept of truth as revelation and therefore\nsomething essentially given to man, or that I prefer the modern\nage's pragmatic assertion that man can know only what he makes\nhimself. My contention is simply that the enormous weight of con-\ntemplation in the traditional hierarchy has blurred the distinctions\nand articulations within the vita activa itself and that, appearances\nnotwithstanding, this condition has not been changed essentially\nby the modern break with the tradition and the eventual reversal of\nits hierarchical order in Marx and Nietzsche. It lies in the very\nnature of the famous “turning upside down” of philosophic systems\nor currently accepted values, that is, in the nature of the operation\nitself, that the conceptual framework is left more or less intact.\n\nThe modern reversal shares with the traditional hierarchy the\nassumption that the same central human preoccupation must pre-\nvail in all activities of men, since without one comprehensive prin-\nciple no order could be established. This assumption is not a mat-\nter of course, and my use of the term vita activa presupposes that\nthe concern underlying all its activities is not the same as and is\nneither superior nor inferior to the central concern of the vita con-\ntemplativa.\n",
        "Section 3. ETERNITY VERSUS IMMORTALITY": "\nThat the various modes of active engagement in the things of this\nworld, on one side, and pure thought culminating in contempla-\ntion, on the other, might correspond to two altogether different\ncentral human concerns has in one way or another been manifest\never since “the men of thought and the men of action began to take\ndifferent paths ,” 16 that is, since the rise of political thought in the\n\n16. See F. M. Cornford, “Plato's Commonwealth,” in Unwritten Philosophy\n(1950), p. 54: “The death of Pericles and the Peloponnesian War mark the mo-\nment when the men of thought and the men of action began to take different\npaths, destined to diverge more and more widely till the Stoic sage ceased to be\na citizen of his own country and became a citizen of the universe.”\n\n[ 17 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nSocratic school. However, when the philosophers discovered — and\nit is probable, though unprovable, that this discovery was made by\nSocrates himself— that the political realm did not as a matter of\ncourse provide for all of man's higher activities, they assumed at\nonce, not that they had found something different in addition to\nwhat was already known, but that they had found a higher prin-\nciple to replace the principle that ruled the polis. The shortest,\nalbeit somewhat superficial, way to indicate these two different\nand to an extent even conflicting principles is to recall the dis-\ntinction between immortality and eternity.\n\nImmortality means endurance in time, deathless life on this\nearth and in this world as it was given, according to Greek under-\nstanding, to nature and the Olympian gods. Against this back-\nground of nature's ever-recurring life and the gods' deathless and\nageless lives stood mortal men, the only mortals in an immortal\nbut not eternal universe, confronted with the immortal lives of\ntheir gods but not under the rule of an eternal God. If we trust\nHerodotus, the difference between the two seems to have been\nstriking to Greek self-understanding prior to the conceptual articu-\nlation of the philosophers, and therefore prior to the specifically\nGreek experiences of the eternal which underlie this articulation.\nHerodotus, discussing Asiatic forms of worship and beliefs in an\ninvisible God, mentions explicitly that compared with this tran-\nscendent God (as we would say today) who is beyond time and\nlife and the universe, the Greek gods are anthropophyeis, have the\nsame nature, not simply the same shape, as man . 17 The Greeks' con-\ncern with immortality grew out of their experience of an immortal\nnature and immortal gods which together surrounded the individu-\nal lives of mortal men. Imbedded in a cosmos where everything\nwas immortal, mortality became the hallmark of human existence.\nMen are “the mortals,” the only mortal things in existence, be-\ncause unlike animals they do not exist only as members of a species\n\n17. Herodotus (i. 131), after reporting that the Persians have “no images of\nthe gods, no temples nor altars, but consider these doings to be foolish,” goes on\nto explain that this shows that they “do not believe, as the Greeks do, that the\ngods are anthropophyeis, of human nature,” or, we may add, that gods and men\nhave the same nature. See also Pindar Carmina Nemaea vi.\n\n[ is 1\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhose immortal life is guaranteed through procreation. 18 The mor-\ntality of men lies in the fact that individual life, with a recogniz-\nable life-story from birth to death, rises out of biological life. This\nindividual life is distinguished from all other things by the recti-\nlinear course of its movement, which, so to speak, cuts through\nthe circular movement of biological life. This is mortality: to move\nalong a rectilinear line in a universe where everything, if it moves\nat all, moves in a cyclical order.\n\n1 he task and potential greatness of mortals lie in their ability\nto produce things— works and deeds and words 19 — which would\ndeserve to be and, at least to a degree, are at home in everlasting-\nness, so that through them mortals could find their place in a cos-\nmos where everything is immortal except themselves. By their\ncapacity for the immortal deed, by their ability to leave non-\nperishable traces behind, men, their individual mortality notwith-\nstanding, attain an immortality of their own and prove themselves\nto be of a “divine” nature. The distinction between man and ani-\nmal runs right through the human species itself: only the best\n( aristoi ), who constantly prove themselves to be the best ( aristeu -\nein, a verb for which there is no equivalent in any other language)\nand who “prefer immortal fame to mortal things,” are really hu-\nman; the others, content with whatever pleasures nature will yield\nthem, live and die like animals. This was still the opinion of Hera-\nclitus, 20 an opinion whose equivalent one will find in hardly any\nphilosopher after Socrates.\n\n18. See Ps. Aristotle Economics 1343b24: Nature guarantees to the species\ntheir being forever through recurrence ( periodos ), but cannot guarantee such be-\ning forever to the individual. The same thought, “For living things, life is being,''\nappears in On the Soul 415bl3.\n\n19. The Greek language does not distinguish between “works” and “deeds,”\nbut calls both erga if they are durable enough to last and great enough to be re-\nmembered. It is only when the philosophers, or rather the Sophists, began to\ndraw their “endless distinctions” and to distinguish between making and acting\n( poiein and prattein) that the nouns poiemata and pragmata received wider cur-\nrency (see Plato's Charmides 163). Homer does not yet know the word pragmata ,\nwhich in Plato ( ta ton anthropon pragmata) is best rendered by “human affairs”\nand has the connotations of trouble and futility. In Herodotus pragmata can have\nthe same connotation (cf., for instance, i. 155).\n\n20. Heraclitus, frag. B29 (Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker [4th ed.; 1922]).\n\n[ 19 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nIn our context it is of no great importance whether Socrates\nhimself or Plato discovered the eternal as the true center of strictly\nmetaphysical thought. It weighs heavily in favor of Socrates that\nhe alone among the great thinkers — unique in this as in many other\nrespects — never cared to write down his thoughts; for it is obvious\nthat, no matter how concerned a thinker may be with eternity, the\nmoment he sits down to write his thoughts he ceases to be con-\ncerned primarily with eternity and shifts his attention to leaving\nsome trace of them. He has entered the vita activa and chosen its\nway of permanence and potential immortality. One thing is cer-\ntain: it is only in Plato that concern with the eternal and the life of\nthe philosopher are seen as inherently contradictory and in conflict\nwith the striving for immortality, the way of life of the citizen, the\nbios politikos.\n\nThe philosopher's experience of the eternal, which to Plato was\narrheton (“unspeakable”), and to Aristotle aneu logon (“without\nword”), and which later was conceptualized in the paradoxical\nnunc stans (“the standing now”), can occur only outside the realm\nof human affairs and outside the plurality of men, as we know\nfrom the Cave parable in Plato's Republic , where the philosopher,\nhaving liberated himself from the fetters that bound him to his fel-\nlow men, leaves the cave in perfect “singularity,” as it were,\nneither accompanied nor followed by others. Politically speaking,\nif to die is the same as “to cease to be among men,” experience of\nthe eternal is a kind of death, and the only thing that separates it\nfrom real death is that it is not final because no living creature can\nendure it for any length of time. And this is precisely what sepa-\nrates the vita contemplativa from the vita activa in medieval\nthought . 21 Yet it is decisive that the experience of the eternal, in\ncontradistinction to that of the immortal, has no correspondence\nwith and cannot be transformed into any activity whatsoever,\nsince even the activity of thought, which goes on within one's self\nby means of words, is obviously not only inadequate to render it\nbut would interrupt and ruin the experience itself.\n\nTheoria, or “contemplation,” is the word given to the experience\nof the eternal, as distinguished from all other attitudes, which at\n\n21. In vita activa fixi permanere possumus; in contemplativa autem intenta mente\nmanere nullo modo valemus (Aquinas Summa theologica ii. 2. 181.4).\n\n[ 20 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nmost may pertain to immortality. It may be that the philosophers'\ndiscovery of the eternal was helped by their very justified doubt of\nthe chances of the polls for immortality or even permanence, and it\nmay be that the shock of this discovery was so overwhelming that\nthey could not but look down upon all striving for immortality as\nvanity and vainglory, certainly placing themselves thereby into\nopen opposition to the ancient city-state and the religion which in-\nspired it. However, the eventual victory of the concern with\neternity over all kinds of aspirations toward immortality is not\ndue to philosophic thought. The fall of the Roman Empire plainly\ndemonstrated that no work of mortal hands can be immortal, and\nit was accompanied by the rise of the Christian gospel of an ever-\nlasting individual life to its position as the exclusive religion of\nWestern mankind. Both together made any striving for an earthly\nimmortality futile and unnecessary. And they succeeded so well\nin making the vita activa and the bios politikos the handmaidens of\ncontemplation that not even the rise of the secular in the modern\nage and the concomitant reversal of the traditional hierarchy be-\ntween action and contemplation sufficed to save from oblivion the\nstriving for immortality which originally had been the spring and\ncenter of the vita activa.\n\n\n[ 21 }\n\n"

    "CHAPTER 2. The Public and the Private Realm": {
        "Section 4. MAN : A SOCIAL OR A POLITICAL ANIMAL": "\nThe vita activa, human life in so far as it is actively engaged in\ndoing something, is always rooted in a world of men and of man-\nmade things which it never leaves or altogether transcends. Things\nand men form the environment for each of man's activities, which\nwould be pointless without such location; yet this environment,\nthe world into which we are born, would not exist without the\nhuman activity which produced it, as in the case of fabricated\nthings; which takes care of it, as in the case of cultivated land; or\nwhich established it through organization, as in the case of the\nbody politic. No human life, not even the life of the hermit in\nnature's wilderness, is possible without a world which directly or\nindirectly testifies to the presence of other human beings.\n\nAll human activities are conditioned by the fact that men live\ntogether, but it is only action that cannot even be imagined out-\nside the society of men. The activity of labor does not need the\npresence of others, though a being laboring in complete solitude\nwould not be human but an animal laborans in the word's most\nliteral significance. Man working and fabricating and building a\nworld inhabited only by himself would still be a fabricator,\nthough not homo faber: he would have lost his specifically human\nquality and, rather, be a god — not, to be sure, the Creator, but a\ndivine demiurge as Plato described him in one of his myths. Action\nalone is the exclusive prerogative of man; neither a beast nor a god\n\n[ 22 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nis capable of it, 1 and only action is entirely dependent upon the\nconstant presence of others.\n\nThis special relationship between action and being together\nseems fully to justify the early translation of Aristotle's zoonpoliti-\nkon by animal socialis, already found in Seneca, which then became\nthe standard translation through Thomas Aquinas: homo est natu-\nraliter politicus, id est, socialis (“man is by nature political, that is,\nsocial”) . 2 More than any elaborate theory, this unconscious sub-\nstitution of the social for the political betrays the extent to which\nthe original Greek understanding of politics had been lost. For\nthis, it is significant but not decisive that the word “social” is\nRoman in origin and has no equivalent in Greek language or\nthought. Yet the Latin usage of the word societas also originally had\na clear, though limited, political meaning; it indicated an alliance\nbetween people for a specific purpose, as when men organize in\norder to rule others or to commit a crime. 3 It is only with the later\n\n1. It seems quite striking that the Homeric gods act only with respect to\nmen, ruling them from afar or interfering in their affairs. Conflicts and strife be-\ntween the gods also seem to arise chiefly from their part in human affairs or\ntheir conflicting partiality with respect to mortals. What then appears is a story\nin which men and gods act together, but the scene is set by the mortals, even\nwhen the decision is arrived at in the assembly of gods on Olympus. I think such\na “co-operation” is indicated in the Homeric erg' andron te them te ( Odyssey i.\n338): the bard sings the deeds of gods and men, not stories of the gods and\nstories of men. Similarly, Hesiod's Theogmy deals not with the deeds of gods\nbut with the genesis of the world (116); it therefore tells how things came into\nbeing through begetting and giving birth (constantly recurring). The singer,\nservant of the Muses, sings “the glorious deeds of men of old and the blessed\ngods” (97 ff.) , but nowhere, as far as I can see, the glorious deeds of the gods.\n\n2. The quotation is from the Index Rerum to the Taurinian edition of Aquinas\n(1922). The word “politicus” does not occur in the text, but the Index summa-\nrizes Thomas' meaning correctly, as can be seen from Summa theologica i. 96. 4;\nii. 2. 109. 3.\n\n3. Societas regni in Livius, societas sceleris in Cornelius Nepos. Such an alliance\ncould also be concluded for business purposes, and Aquinas still holds that a\n“true societas ” between businessmen exists only “where the investor himself\nshares in the risk,” that is, where the partnership is truly an alliance (see\nW. J. Ashley, An lntroductim to English Economic History and Theory [1931],\np. 419).\n\n\nf 23 1\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nconcept of a societas generis humani , a “society of man-kind,” 4\nthat the term “social” begins to acquire the general meaning of a\nfundamental human condition. It is not that Plato or Aristotle was\nignorant of, or unconcerned with, the fact that man cannot live\noutside the company of men, but they did not count this condition\namong the specifically human characteristics; on the contrary, it\nwas something human life had in common with animal life, and\nfor this reason alone it could not be fundamentally human. The\nnatural, merely social companionship of the human species was\nconsidered to be a limitation imposed upon us by the needs of bio-\nlogical life, which are the same for the human animal as for other\nforms of animal life.\n\nAccording to Greek thought, the human capacity for political\norganization is not only different from but stands in direct oppo-\nsition to that natural association whose center is the home ( oikia )\nand the family. The rise of the city-state meant that man received\n“besides his private life a sort of second life, his bios politikos . Now\nevery citizen belongs to two orders of existence; and there is a\nsharp distinction in his life between what is his own (idion) and\nwhat is communal ( koinon ).” 6 It was not just an opinion or theory\nof Aristotle but a simple historical fact that the foundation of the\npolis was preceded by the destruction of all organized units resting\non kinship, such as th ephratria and the phyle . 6 Of all the activities\n\n4. I use here and in the following the word “man-kind” to designate the hu-\nman species, as distinguished from “mankind,” which indicates the sum total\nof human beings.\n\n5. Werner Jaeger, Paideia (1945), III, 111.\n\n6. Although Fustel de Coulanges' chief thesis, according to the Introduction\nto The Ancient City (Anchor ed.; 1956), consists of demonstrating that “the\nsame religion” formed the ancient family organization and the ancient city-state,\nhe brings numerous references to the fact that the regime of the gens based on\nthe religion of the family and the regime of the city “were in reality two antag-\nonistic forms of government. . . . Either the city could not last, or it must in\nthe course of time break up the family” (p. 252). The reason for the contra-\ndiction in this great book seems to me to be in Coulanges' attempt to treat\nRome and the Greek city-states together; for his evidence and categories he\nrelies chiefly on Roman institutional and political sentiment, although he recog-\nnizes that the Vesta cult “became weakened in Greece at a very early date . . .\nbut it never became enfeebled at Rome” (p. 146) . Not only was the gulf between\nhousehold and city much deeper in Greece than in Rome, but only in Greece\n\n[ 24 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nnecessary and present in human communities, only two were\ndeemed to be political and to constitute what Aristotle called the\nbios politikos, namely action (praxis ) and speech (lexis), out of\nwhich rises the realm of human affairs (ta ton anthropon pragmata,\nas Plato used to call it) from which everything merely necessary\nor useful is strictly excluded.\n\nHowever, while certainly only the foundation of the city-state\nenabled men to spend their whole lives in the political realm, in\naction and speech, the conviction that these two human capacities\nbelonged together and are the highest of all seems to have preceded\nthe polis and was already present in pre-Socratic thought. The\nstature of the Homeric Achilles can be understood only if one\nsees him as “the doer of great deeds and the speaker of great\nwords .” 7 In distinction from modern understanding, such words\nwere not considered to be great because they expressed great\nthoughts; on the contrary, as we know from the last lines of\nAntigone, it may be the capacity for “great words” ( megaloi logoi)\nwith which to reply to striking blows that will eventually teach\nthought in old age . 8 Thought was secondary to speech, but\n\nwas the Olympian religion, the religion of Homer and the city-state, separate\nfrom and superior to the older religion of family and household. While Vesta,\nthe goddess of the hearth, became the protectress of a “city hearth” and part of\nthe official, political cult after the unification and second foundation of Rome,\nher Greek colleague, Hestia, is mentioned for the first time by Hesiod, the only\nGreek poet who, in conscious opposition to Homer, praises the life of the\nhearth and the household; in the official religion of the polis, she had to\ncede her place in the assembly of the twelve Olympian gods to Dionysos (see\nMommsen, Romische Geschichte [5th ed.], Book I, ch. 12, and Robert Graves,\nThe Greek Myths [1955], 27. k).\n\n7. The passage occurs in Phoenix' speech, Iliad ix. 443. It clearly refers to\neducation for war and agora, the public meeting, in which men can distinguish\nthemselves. The literal translation is; “[your father] charged me to teach you\nall this, to be a speaker of words and a doer of deeds” (mython te rheier' emeriai\nprcktera te ergon) .\n\n8. The literal translation of the last lines of Antigone (1350-54) is as fol-\nlows: “But great words, counteracting [or paying back] the great blows\nof the overproud, teach understanding in old age.” The content of these lines\nis so puzzling to modem understanding that one rarely finds a translator who dares\nto give the bare sense. An exception is Holderlin's translation: “Grosse Blicke\naber, / Grosse Streiche der hohen Schultern / Vergeltend, / Sie haben im Alter\n\n[ 25 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nspeech and action were considered to be coeval and coequal, of the\nsame rank and the same kind; and this originally meant not only\nthat most political action, in so far as it remains outside the sphere\nof violence, is indeed transacted in words, but more fundamentally\nthat finding the right words at the right moment, quite apart from\nthe information or communication they may convey, is action.\nOnly sheer violence is mute, and for this reason violence alone\ncan never be great. Even when, relatively late in antiquity, the\narts of war and speech ( rhetoric ) emerged as the two principal\npolitical subjects of education, the development was still inspired\nby this older pr e-polis experience and tradition and remained sub-\nject to it.\n\nIn the experience of the polis, which not without justification\nhas been called the most talkative of all bodies politic, and even\nmore in the political philosophy which sprang from it, action and\nspeech separated and became more and more independent activi-\nties. The emphasis shifted from action to speech, and to speech as\na means of persuasion rather than the specifically human way of\nanswering, talking back and measuring up to whatever happened\nor was done . 9 To be political, to live in a polis, meant that every-\nthing was decided through words and persuasion and not through\nforce and violence. In Greek self-understanding, to force people\n\n\ngelehrt, zu denken.” An anecdote, reported by Plutarch, may illustrate the con-\nnection between acting and speaking on a much lower level. A man once ap-\nproached Demosthenes and related how terribly he had been beaten. “But you,”\nsaid Demosthenes, “suffered nothing of what you tell me.” Whereupon the other\nraised his voice and cried out: “I suffered nothing?” “Now,” said Demosthenes,\n“I hear the voice of somebody who was injured and who suffered” (Lives,\n“Demosthenes”) . A last remnant of this ancient connection of speech and thought,\nfrom which our notion of expressing thought through words is absent, may be\nfound in the current Ciceronian phrase of ratio et oratio.\n\n9. It is characteristic for this development that every politician was called a\n“rhetor” and that rhetoric, the art of public speaking, as distinguished from di-\nalectic, the art of philosophic speech, is defined by Aristotle as the art of per-\nsuasion (see Rhetoric 1354al2 ff., 1355b26 ff.). (The distinction itself is derived\nfrom Plato, Gorgias 448.) It is in this sense that we must understand the Greek\nopinion of the decline of Thebes, which was ascribed to Theban neglect of\nrhetoric in favor of military exercise (see Jacob Burckhardt, Griechische Kultur-\ngeschichte, ed. Kroener, III, 190).\n\n[ 2d ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nby violence, to command rather than persuade, were prepolitical\nways to deal with people characteristic of life outside the polls, of\nhome and family life, where the household head ruled with uncon-\ntested, despotic powers, or of life in the barbarian empires of Asia,\nwhose despotism was frequently likened to the organization of the\nhousehold.\n\nAristotle's definition of man as zoon politikon was not only un-\nrelated and even opposed to the natural association experienced\nin household life; it can be fully understood only if one adds his\nsecond famous definition of man as a zoon logon ekhon (“a living\nbeing capable of speech”) . The Latin translation of this term into\nanimal rationale rests on no less fundamental a misunderstanding\nthan the term “social animal.” Aristotle meant neither to define\nman in general nor to indicate man's highest capacity, which to\nhim was not logos , that is, not speech or reason, but nous , the\ncapacity of contemplation, whose chief characteristic is that its\ncontent cannot be rendered in speech . 10 In his two most famous\ndefinitions, Aristotle only formulated the current opinion of the\npolls about man and the political way of life, and according to this\nopinion, everybody outside the polls — slaves and barbarians— was\naneu logou , deprived, of course, not of the faculty of speech, but of\na way of life in which speech and only speech made sense and\nwhere the central concern of all citizens was to talk with each\nother.\n\nThe profound misunderstanding expressed in the Latin transla-\ntion of “political” as “social” is perhaps nowhere clearer than in\na discussion in wLich Thomas Aquinas compares the nature of\nhousehold rule with political rule: the head of the household, he\nfinds, has some similarity to the head of the kingdom, but, he adds,\nhis power is not so “perfect” as that of the king . 11 Not only in\nGreece and the polls but throughout the whole of occidental an-\ntiquity, it would indeed have been self-evident that even the power\nof the tyrant was less great, less “perfect” than the power with\nwhich the paterfamilias , the domlnus , ruled over his household of\nslaves and family. And this was not because the power of the city's\n\n10. Nicomachean Ethics 1142a25 and 1178a6 fF.\n\n11. Aquinas op. cit. ii. 2.

        "Section 5. THE Polis AND THE HOUSEHOLD": "\nAlthough misunderstanding and equating the political and social\nrealms is as old as the translation of Greek terms into Latin and\ntheir adaption to Roman-Christian thought, it has become even\nmore confusing in modern usage and modem understanding of\nsociety. The distinction between a private and a public sphere of\nlife corresponds to the household and the political realms, which\nhave existed as distinct, separate entities at least since the rise of\nthe ancient city-state; but the emergence of the social realm,\nwhich is neither private nor public, strictly speaking, is a rela-\ntively new phenomenon whose origin coincided with the emer-\ngence of the modern age and which found its political form in the\nnation-state.\n\nWhat concerns us in this context is the extraordinary difficulty\nwith which we, because of this development, understand the deci-\nsive division between the public and private realms, between the\nsphere of the polls and the sphere of household and family, and,\nfinally, between activities related to a common world and those\nrelated to the maintenance of life, a division upon which all\nancient political thought rested as self-evident and axiomatic. In\nour understanding, the dividing line is entirely blurred, because\nwe see the body of peoples and political communities in the image\nof a family whose everyday affairs have to be taken care of by a\ngigantic, nation-wide administration of housekeeping. The scien-\ntific thought that corresponds to this development is no longer\npolitical science but “national economy” or “social economy” or\nVolkswirtschaft, all of which indicate a kind of “collective house-\n\n12.

Wallon, Histoire de Vesclavage dans I'antiquite [1847], III, 21).\n\n[ 25 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nkeeping ”; 13 the collective of families economically organized into\nthe facsimile of one super-human family is what we call “society,”\nand its political form of organization is called “nation .” 14 We\ntherefore find it difficult to realize that according to ancient\nthought on these matters, the very term “political economy”\nwould have been a contradiction in terms: whatever was “eco-\nnomic,” related to the life of the individual and the survival of the\nspecies, was a non-political, household affair by definition . 16\n\nHistorically, it is very likely that the rise of the city-state and\nthe public realm occurred at the expense of the private realm of\nfamily and household . 16 Yet the old sanctity of the hearth, though\nmuch less pronounced in classical Greece than in ancient Rome,\nwas never entirely lost. What prevented the polls from violating\nthe private lives of its citizens and made it hold sacred the bound-\naries surrounding each property was not respect for private prop-\nerty as we understand it, but the fact that without owning a house\n\n13. According to Gunnar Myrdal {The Political Element in the Development of\nEconomic Theory [1953], p. xl), the “idea of Social Economy or collective house-\nkeeping ( Volkswirtschaft )” is one of the “three main foci” around which “the\npolitical speculation which has permeated economics from the very beginning is\nfound to he crystallized.”\n\n14. This is not to deny that the nation-state and its society grew out of the\nmedieval kingdom and feudalism, in whose framework the family and household\nunit have an importance unequalled in classical antiquity. The difference, how-\never, is marked. Within the feudal framework, families and households were mu-\ntually almost independent, so that the royal household, representing a given terri-\ntorial region and ruling the feudal lords as primus inter pares , did not pretend,\nlike an absolute ruler, to be the head of one family. The medieval “nation” was a\nconglomeration of families; its members did not think of themselves as members\nof one family comprehending the whole nation.\n\n15. The distinction is very clear in the first paragraphs of the Ps. Aristotelian\nEconomics, because it opposes the despotic one-man rule ( mon-archia ) of the\nhousehold organization to the altogether different organization of the polis.\n\n16. In Athens, one may see the turning point in Solon's legislation. Cou*\nlanges rightly sees in the Athenian law that made it a filial duty to support par-\nents the proof of the loss of paternal power {op. cit., pp. 3 1 5-1 6) . However, pater-\nnal power was limited only if it conflicted with the interest of the city and never\nfor the sake of the individual family member. Thus the sale of children and the\nexposure of infants lasted throughout antiquity (see R. H. Barrow, Slavery in\nthe Roman Empire [1928], p. 8: “Other rights in the patria potestas had become\nobsolete; but the right of exposure remained unforbidden till a.d. 374”).\n\nr 2.9 i\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\na man could not participate in the affairs of the world because he\nhad no location in it which was properly his own . 17 Even Plato,\nwhose political plans foresaw the abolition of private property\nand an extension of the public sphere to the point of annihilating\nprivate life altogether, still speaks with great reverence of Zeus\nHerkeios, the protector of border lines, and calls the horoi, the\nboundaries between one estate and another, divine, without seeing\nany contradiction . 18\n\nThe distinctive trait of the household sphere was that in it men\nlived together because they were driven by their wants and needs.\nThe driving force was life itself— the penates, the household gods,\nwere, according to Plutarch, “the gods who make us live and\nnourish our body” 19 — which, for its individual maintenance and\nits survival as the life of the species needs the company of others.\nThat individual maintenance should be the task of the man and\nspecies survival the task of the woman was obvious, and both of\nthese natural functions, the labor of man to provide nourishment\nand the labor of the woman in giving birth, were subject to the\nsame urgency of life. Natural community in the household there-\nfore was born of necessity, and necessity ruled over all activities\nperformed in it.\n\nThe realm of the polls , on the contrary, was the sphere of free-\ndom, and if there was a relationship between these two spheres, it\nwas a matter of course that the mastering of the necessities of life\n\n17. It is interesting for this distinction that there were Greek cities where\ncitizens were obliged by law to share their harvest and consume it in common,\nwhereas each of them had the absolute uncontested property of his soil. See Cou-\nIanges {op. cit., p. 61), who calls this law “a singular contradiction”; it is no con-\ntradiction, because these two types of property had nothing in common in ancient\nunderstanding.\n\n18. See Laws 842.\n\n19. Quoted from Coulanges, op. cit., p. 96; the reference to Plutarch is Quaes-\ntiones Romanae 51. It seems strange that Coulanges' one-sided emphasis on the\nunderworld deities in Greek and Roman religion should have overlooked that\nthese gods were not mere gods of the dead and the cult not merely a “death cult,”\nbut that this early earth-bound religion served life and death as two aspects of the\nsame process. Life rises out of the earth and returns to it; birth and death are but\ntwo different stages of the same biological life over which the subterranean gods\nhold sway.\n\n\n[ 30 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nin the household was the condition for freedom of the polls. Under\nno circumstances could politics be only a means to protect society\n— a society of the faithful, as in the Middle Ages, or a society of\nproperty-owners, as in Locke, or a society relentlessly engaged in\na process of acquisition, as in Hobbes, or a society of producers,\nas in Marx, or a society of jobholders, as in our own society, or\na society of laborers, as in socialist and communist countries. In\nall these cases, it is the freedom (and in some instances so-called\nfreedom) of society which requires and justifies the restraint of\npolitical authority. Freedom is located in the realm of the social,\nand force or violence becomes the monopoly of government.\n\nWhat all Greek philosophers, no matter how opposed to polls\nlife, took for granted is that freedom is exclusively located in the\npolitical realm, that necessity is primarily a prepolitical phenome-\nnon, characteristic of the private household organization, and that\nforce and violence are justified in this sphere because they are the\nonly means to master necessity — for instance, by ruling over\nslaves — and to become free. Because all human beings are subject\nto necessity, they are entitled to violence toward others; violence\nis the prepolitical act of liberating oneself from the necessity of\nlife for the freedom of world. This freedom is the essential condi-\ntion of what the Greeks called felicity, eudaimonia, which was an\nobjective status depending first of all upon wealth and health. To\nbe poor or to be in ill health meant to be subject to physical neces-\nsity, and to be a slave meant to be subject, in addition, to man-\nmade violence. This twofold and doubled “unhappiness” of slavery\nis quite independent of the actual subjective well-being of the slave.\nThus, a poor free man preferred the insecurity of a daily-changing\nlabor market to regular assured work, which, because it restricted\nhis freedom to do as he pleased every day, was already felt to be\nservitude ( douleia ), and even harsh, painful labor was preferred to\nthe easy life of many household slaves . 20\n\n20. The discussion between Socrates and Eutherus in Xenophon's Memora-\nbilia (ii. 8) is quite interesting: Eutherus is forced by necessity to labor with his\nbody and is sure that his body will not be able to stand this kind of life for very\nlong and also that in his old age he will be destitute. Still, he thinks that to labor\nis better than to beg. Whereupon Socrates proposes that he look for somebody\n“who is better off and needs an assistant.” Eutherus replies that he could not\nbear servitude {douleia).\n\n[ 31 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe prepolitical force, however, with which the head of the\nhousehold ruled over the family and its slaves and which was felt\nto be necessary because man is a “social” before he is a “political\nanimal,” has nothing in common with the chaotic “state of nature”\nfrom whose violence, according to seventeenth-century political\nthought, men could escape only by establishing a government that,\nthrough a monopoly of power and of violence, would abolish the\n“war of all against all” by “keeping them all in awe .” 21 On the\ncontrary, the whole concept of rule and being ruled, of govern-\nment and power in the sense in which we understand them as well\nas the regulated order attending them, was felt to be prepolitical\nand to belong in the private rather than the public sphere.\n\nThe polls was distinguished from the household in that it knew\nonly “equals,” whereas the household was the center of the strict-\nest inequality. To be free meant both not to be subject to the\nnecessity of life or to the command of another and not to be in\ncommand oneself. It meant neither to rule nor to be ruled . 22 Thus\nwithin the realm of the household, freedom did not exist, for the\nhousehold head, its ruler, was considered to be free only in so far\nas he had the power to leave the household and enter the political\nrealm, where all were equals. To be sure, this equality of the\npolitical realm has very little in common with our concept of\nequality: it meant to live among and to have to deal only with one's\npeers, and it presupposed the existence of “unequals” who, as a\nmatter of fact, were always the majority of the population in a\ncity-state . 23 Equality, therefore, far from being connected with\n\n21. The reference is to Hobbes, Leviathan , Part I, ch. 13.\n\n22. The most famous and the most beautiful reference is the discussion of the\ndifferent forms of government in Herodotus (iii. 80-83), where Otanes, the de-\nfender of Greek equality ( isonomie ), states that he “wishes neither to rule nor to\nbe ruled.” But it is the same spirit in which Aristotle states that the life of a free\nman is better than that of a despot, denying freedom to the despot as a matter of\ncourse ( Politics 1325a24). According to Coulanges, all Greek and Latin words\nwhich express some rulership over others, such as rex, pater, anax, basileus, refer\noriginally to household relationships and were names the slaves gave to their\nmaster (op. cit., pp. 89 ff., 228) .\n\n23. The proportion varied and is certainly exaggerated in Xenophon's report\nfrom Sparta, where among four thousand people in the market place, a foreigner\ncounted no more than sixty citizens ( Hellenica iii. 35).\n\n[ ^ ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\njustice, as in modem times, was the very essence of freedom: to\nbe free meant to be free from the inequality present in rulership\nand to move in a sphere where neither rule nor being ruled\nexisted.\n\nHowever, the possibility of describing the profound difference\nbetween the modern and the ancient understanding of politics in\nterms of a clear-cut opposition ends here. In the modern world,\nthe social and the political realms are much less distinct. That\npolitics is nothing but a function of society, that action, speech,\nand thought are primarily superstructures upon social interest, is\nnot a discovery of Karl Marx but on the contrary is among the\naxiomatic assumptions Marx accepted uncritically from the politi-\ncal economists of the modern age. This functionalization makes it\nimpossible to perceive any serious gulf between the two realms;\nand this is not a matter of a theory or an ideology, since with the\nrise of society, that is, the rise of the “household” ( oikia ) or of\neconomic activities to the public realm, housekeeping and all mat-\nters pertaining formerly to the private sphere of the family have\nbecome a “collective” concern . 24 In the modern world, the two\nrealms indeed constantly flow into each other like waves in the\nnever-resting stream of the life process itself.\n\nThe disappearance of the gulf that the ancients had to cross\ndaily to transcend the narrow realm of the household and “rise”\ninto the realm of politics is an essentially modern phenomenon.\nSuch a gulf between the private and the public still existed some-\nhow in the Middle Ages, though it had lost much of its significance\n\n24. See Myrdal,oj>. cit.; “The notion that society, like the head of a family,\nkeeps house for its members, is deeply rooted in economic terminology. ... In\nGerman Volkswirtschaftslehre suggests . . . that there is a collective subject of\neconomic activity . . . with a common purpose and common values. In English,\n\n. . . ‘theory of wealth' or ‘theory of welfare' express similar ideas” (p. 140) . “What\nis meant by a social economy whose function is social housekeeping? In the first\nplace, it implies or suggests an analogy between the individual who runs his own\nor his family household and society. Adam Smith and James Mill elaborated this\nanalogy explicitly. After J. S. Mill's criticism, and with the wider recognition of\nthe distinction between practical and theoretical political economy, the analogy\nwas generally less emphasized” (p. 143) . The fact that the analogy was no longer\nused may also be due to a development in which society devoured the family\nunit until it became a full-fledged substitute for it.\n\nr « ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nand changed its location entirely. It has been rightly remarked\nthat after the downfall of the Roman Empire, it was the Catholic\nChurch that offered men a substitute for the citizenship which\nhad formerly been the prerogative of municipal government . 26 The\nmedieval tension between the darkness of everyday life and the\ngrandiose splendor attending everything sacred, with the con-\ncomitant rise from the secular to the religious, corresponds in\nmany respects to the rise from the private to the public in antiq-\nuity. The difference is of course very marked, for no matter how\n“worldly” the Church became, it was always essentially an other-\nworldly concern which kept the community of believers together.\nWhile one can equate the public with the religious only with some\ndifficulty, the secular realm under the rule of feudalism was in-\ndeed in its entirety what the private realm had been in antiquity.\nIts hallmark was the absorption of all activities into the household\nsphere, where they had only private significance, and conse-\nquently the very absence of a public realm . 26\n\nIt is characteristic of this growth of the private realm, and inci-\ndentally of the difference between the ancient household head and\nthe feudal lord, that the feudal lord could render justice within\nthe limits of his rule, whereas the ancient household head, while\nhe might exert a milder or harsher rule, knew neither of laws nor\njustice outside the political realm . 27 The bringing of all human\n\n25. R. H. Barrow, The Romans (1953), p. 194.\n\n26. The characteristics which E. Levasseur ( Histoire des classes ouvrieres et\nle de I'industrie en France avant 1789 [1900]) finds for the feudal organization of\nlabor are true for the whole of feudal communities: “Chacun vivait chez soi et\nvivait de soi-meme, le noble sur sa seigneurie, le vilain sur sa culture, le citadin\ndans sa ville” (p. 229).\n\n27. The fair treatment of slaves which Plato recommends in the Laws (777)\nhas little to do with justice and is not recommended “out of regard for the\n[slaves], but more out of respect to ourselves.” For the coexistence of two laws,\nthe political law of justice and the household law of rule, see Wallon, op. cit., II,\n200: “La loi, pendant bien longtemps, done . . . s'abstenait de penetrer dans la\nfamille, ou elle reconnaissait l'empire d'une autre loi.” Ancient, especially\nRoman, jurisdiction with respect to household matters, treatment of slaves,\nfamily relationships, etc., was essentially designed to restrain the otherwise\nunrestricted power of the household head; that there could be a rule of jus-\ntice within the entirely “private” society of the slaves themselves was unthink-\n\n[ S4 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nactivities into the private realm and the modeling of all human\nrelationships upon the example of the household reached far into\nthe specifically medieval professional organizations in the cities\nthemselves, the guilds, confreries , and compagnons, and even into\nthe early business companies, where “the original joint household\nwould seem to be indicated by the very word ‘company' (com-\npants ) . . . [and] such phrases as ‘men who eat one bread,' ‘men\nwho have one bread and one wine.' ” 28 The medieval concept of\nthe “common good,” far from indicating the existence of a politi-\ncal realm, recognizes only that private individuals have interests\nin common, material and spiritual, and that they can retain their\nprivacy and attend to their own business only if one of them takes\nit upon himself to look out for this common interest. What dis-\ntinguishes this essentially Christian attitude toward politics from\nthe modern reality is not so much the recognition of a “common\ngood” as the exclusivity of the private sphere and the absence of\nthat curiously hybrid realm where private interests assume public\nsignificance that we call “society.”\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that medieval political thought,\nconcerned exclusively with the secular realm, remained unaware\nof the gulf between the sheltered life in the household and the\nmerciless exposure of the polls and, consequently, of the virtue of\ncourage as one of the most elemental political attitudes. What\nremains surprising is that the only postclassical political theorist\nwho, in an extraordinary effort to restore its old dignity to poli-\ntics, perceived the gulf and understood something of the courage\nneeded to cross it was Machiavelli, who described it in the rise\n“of the Condottiere from low condition to high rank,” from\nprivacy to princedom, that is, from circumstances common to all\nmen to the shining glory of great deeds . 29\n\nable — they were by definition outside the realm of the law and subject to the\nrule of their master. Only the master himself, in so far as he was also a citizen,\nwas subject to the rules of laws, which for the sake of the city eventually even\ncurtailed his powers in the household.\n\n28. W. J. Ashley, op. cit., p. 415.\n\n29. This “rise” from one realm or rank to a higher is a recurrent theme in\nMachiavelli (see esp. Prince, ch. 6 about Hiero of Syracuse and ch. 7 ; and Dis-\ncourses, Book II, ch. 13).\n\n\n[ BS }\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nTo leave the household, originally in order to embark upon\nsome adventure and glorious enterprise and later simply to devote\none's life to the affairs of the city, demanded courage because only\nin the household was one primarily concerned with one's own life\nand survival. Whoever entered the political realm had first to be\nready to risk his life, and too great a love for life obstructed free-\ndom, was a sure sign of slavishness . 80 Courage therefore became\nthe political virtue par excellence, and only those men who pos-\nsessed it could be admitted to a fellowship that was political in\ncontent and purpose and thereby transcended the mere together-\nness imposed on all— slaves, barbarians, and Greeks alike —\nthrough the urgencies of life . 31 The “good life,” as Aristotle called\nthe life of the citizen, therefore was not merely better, more care-\nfree or nobler than ordinary life, but of an altogether different\n\n30. “By Solon's time slavery had come to be looked on as worse than death”\n(Robert Schlaifer, “Greek Theories of Slavery from Homer to Aristotle,” Har-\nvard Studies in Classical Philology [1936], XLVII). Since then, pkilopsychia\n(“love of life”) and cowardice became identified with slavishness. Thus, Plato\ncould believe he had demonstrated the natural slavishness of slaves by the fact\nthat they had not preferred death to enslavement ( Republic 386A). A late echo\nof this might still be found in Seneca's answer to the complaints of slaves: “Is\nfreedom so close at hand, yet is there any one a slave?” ( Ep . 77. 14) or in his\nvita si manendi virtue abest, servitus est — “life is slavery without the virtue which\nknows how to die” (77. 13). To understand the ancient attitude toward slavery,\nit is not immaterial to remember that the majority of slaves were defeated ene-\nmies and that generally only a small percentage were born slaves. And while\nunder the Roman Republic slaves were, on the whole, drawn from outside the\nlimits of Roman rule, Greek slaves usually were of the same nationality as their\nmasters; they had proved their slavish nature by not committing suicide, and\nsince courage was the political virtue par excellence, they had thereby shown\ntheir “natural” unworthiness, their unfitness to be citizens. The attitude toward\nslaves changed in the Roman Empire, not only because of the influence of Stoi-\ncism but because a much greater portion of the slave population were slaves by\nbirth. But even in Rome, la, bos is considered to be closely connected with un-\nglorious death by Vergil ( Aeneis vi) .\n\n3 1 . That the free man distinguishes himself from the slave through courage\nseems to have been the theme of a poem by the Cretan poet Hybrias: “My\nriches are spear and sword and the beautiful shield. . . . But those who do not\ndare to bear spear and sword and the beautiful shield that protects the body fall\nall down unto their knees with awe and address me as Lord and great King”\n(quoted from Eduard Meyer, Die Sklaverei im Altertum [1898], p. 22).\n\n[ 36 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nquality. It was “good” to the extent that by having mastered the\nnecessities of sheer life, by being freed from labor and work, and\nby overcoming the innate urge of all living creatures for their\nown survival, it was no longer bound to the biological life process.\n\nAt the root of Greek political consciousness we find an un-\nequaled clarity and articulateness in drawing this distinction. No\nactivity that served only the purpose of making a living, of sus-\ntaining only the life process, was permitted to enter the political\nrealm, and this at the grave risk of abandoning trade and manufac-\nture to the industriousness of slaves and foreigners, so that Athens\nindeed became the “pensionopolis” with a “proletariat of con-\nsumers” which Max Weber so vividly described . 32 The true char-\nacter of this polls is still quite manifest in Plato's and Aristotle's\npolitical philosophies, even if the borderline between household\nand polls is occasionally blurred, especially in Plato who, proba-\nbly following Socrates, began to draw his examples and illustra-\ntions for the polls from everyday experiences in private life, but\nalso in Aristotle when he, following Plato, tentatively assumed\nthat at least the historical origin of the polls must be connected\nwith the necessities of life and that only its content or inherent\naim ( telos ) transcends life in the “good life.”\n\nThese aspects of the teachings of the Socratic school, which\nsoon were to become axiomatic to the point of banality, were then\nthe newest and most revolutionary of all and sprang not from\nactual experience in political life but from the desire to be freed\nfrom its burden, a desire which in their own understanding the\nphilosophers could justify only by demonstrating that even this\nfreest of all ways of life was still connected with and subject to\nnecessity. But the background of actual political experience, at\nleast in Plato and Aristotle, remained so strong that the distinction\nbetween the spheres of household and political life was never\ndoubted. Without mastering the necessities of life in the house-\nhold, neither life nor the “good life” is possible, but politics is\nnever for the sake of life. As far as the members of the polls are\nconcerned, household life exists for the sake of the “good life” in\nthe polls.\n\n32.

        "Section 6. THE RISE OF THE SOCIAL": "\nThe emergence of society — the rise of housekeeping, its activi-\nties, problems, and organizational devices — from the shadowy in-\nterior of the household into the light of the public sphere, has not\nonly blurred the old borderline between private and political, it\nhas also changed almost beyond recognition the meaning of the\ntwo terms and their significance for the life of the individual and\nthe citizen. Not only would we not agree with the Greeks that a\nlife spent in the privacy of “one's own” ( idion ), outside the world\nof the common, is “idiotic” by definition, or with the Romans to\nwhom privacy offered but a temporary refuge from the business of\nthe res publica; we call private today a sphere of intimacy whose\nbeginnings we may be able to trace back to late Roman, though\nhardly to any period of Greek antiquity, but whose peculiar\nmanifoldness and variety were certainly unknown to any period\nprior to the modern age.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of shifted emphasis. In ancient\nfeeling the privative trait of privacy, indicated in the word itself,\nwas all-important; it meant literally a state of being deprived of\nsomething, and even of the highest and most human of man's\ncapacities. A man who lived only a private life, who like the\nslave was not permitted to enter the public realm, or like the bar-\nbarian had chosen not to establish such a realm, was not fully\nhuman. We no longer think primarily of deprivation when we\nuse the word “privacy,” and this is partly due to the enormous\nenrichment of the private sphere through modern individualism.\nHowever, it seems even more important that modern privacy is\nat least as sharply opposed to the social realm — unknown to the\nancients who considered its content a private matter— as it is to\nthe political, properly speaking. The decisive historical fact is\nthat modern privacy in its most relevant function, to shelter the\nintimate, was discovered as the opposite not of the political sphere\nbut of the social, to which it is therefore more closely and authen-\ntically related.\n\nThe first articulate explorer and to an extent even theorist of\n\n[ 38 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nintimacy was Jean-Jacques Rousseau who, characteristically\nenough, is the only great author still frequently cited by his first\nname alone. He arrived at his discovery through a rebellion not\nagainst the oppression of the state but against society's unbearable\nperversion of the human heart, its intrusion upon an innermost\nregion in man which until then had needed no special protection.\nThe intimacy of the heart, unlike the private household, has no\nobjective tangible place in the world, nor can the society against\nwhich it protests and asserts itself be localized with the same cer-\ntainty as the public space. To Rousseau, both the intimate and the\nsocial were, rather, subjective modes of human existence, and in\nhis case, it was as though Jean-Jacques rebelled against a man\ncalled Rousseau. The modern individual and his endless conflicts,\nhis inability either to be at home in society or to live outside it\naltogether, his ever-changing moods and the radical subjectivism\nof his emotional life, was born in this rebellion of the heart. The\nauthenticity of Rousseau's discovery is beyond doubt, no matter\nhow doubtful the authenticity of the individual who was Rousseau.\nThe astonishing flowering of poetry and music from the middle\nof the eighteenth century until almost the last third of the nine-\nteenth, accompanied by the rise of the novel, the only entirely\nsocial art form, coinciding with a no less striking decline of all\nthe more public arts, especially architecture, is sufficient testi-\nmony to a close relationship between the social and the intimate.\n\nThe rebellious reaction against society during which Rousseau\nand the Romanticists discovered intimacy was directed first of all\nagainst the leveling demands of the social, against what we would\ncall today the conformism inherent in every society. It is impor-\ntant to remember that this rebellion took place before the prin-\nciple of equality, upon which we have blamed conformism since\nTocqueville, had had the time to assert itself in either the social\nor the political realm. Whether a nation consists of equals or\nnon-equals is of no great importance in this respect, for society\nalways demands that its members act as though they were mem-\nbers of one enormous family which has only one opinion and one\ninterest. Before the modern disintegration of the family, this com-\nmon interest and single opinion was represented by the household\nhead who ruled in accordance with it and prevented possible dis-\n\n[ ^ 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nunity among the family members . 33 The striking coincidence of\nthe rise of society with the decline of the family indicates clearly\nthat what actually took place was the absorption of the family\nunit into corresponding social groups. The equality of the mem-\nbers of these groups, far from being an equality among peers, re-\nsembles nothing so much as the equality of household members\nbefore the despotic power of the household head, except that in\nsociety, where the natural strength of one common interest and\none unanimous opinion is tremendously enforced by sheer num-\nber, actual rule exerted by one man, representing the common\ninterest and the right opinion, could eventually be dispensed with.\nThe phenomenon of conformism is characteristic of the last stage\nof this modern development.\n\nIt is true that one-man, monarchical rule, which the ancients\nstated to be the organizational device of the household, is trans-\nformed in society — as we know it today, when the peak of the\nsocial order is no longer formed by the royal household of an ab-\nsolute ruler — into a kind of no-man rule. But this nobody, the\nassumed one interest of society as a whole in economics as well\nas the assumed one opinion of polite society in the salon, does not\ncease to rule for having lost its personality. As we know from the\nmost social form of government, that is, from bureaucracy (the\nlast stage of government in the nation-state just as one-man rule\nin benevolent despotism and absolutism was its first) , the rule by\nnobody is not necessarily no-rule; it may indeed, under certain\ncircumstances, even turn out to be one of its crudest and most\ntyrannical versions.\n\nIt is decisive that society, on all its levels, excludes the possi-\nbility of action, which formerly was excluded from the house-\nhold. Instead, society expects from each of its members a certain\nkind of behavior, imposing innumerable and various rules, all of\nwhich tend to “normalize” its members, to make them behave,\nto exclude spontaneous action or outstanding achievement. With\n\n3 3. This is well illustrated by a remark of Seneca, who, discussing the useful-\nness of highly educated slaves (who know all the classics by heart) to an as-\nsumedly rather ignorant master, comments: “What the household knows the\nmaster knows” ( Ep . 27. 6, quoted from Barrow, Slavery in the Roman Empire,\n\np. 61 ).\n\n\n[ 40 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nRousseau, we find these demands in the salons of high society,\nwhose conventions always equate the individual with his rank\nwithin the social framework. What matters is this equation with\nsocial status, and it is immaterial whether the framework happens\nto be actual rank in the half-feudal society of the eighteenth cen-\ntury, title in the class society of the nineteenth, or mere function\nin the mass society of today. The rise of mass society, on the con-\ntrary, only indicates that the various social groups have suffered\nthe same absorption into one society that the family units had\nsuffered earlier; with the emergence of mass society, the realm of\nthe social has finally, after several centuries of development,\nreached the point where it embraces and controls all members of\na given community equally and with equal strength. But society\nequalizes under all circumstances, and the victory of equality in\nthe modern world is only the political and legal recognition of the\nfact that society has conquered the public realm, and that dis-\ntinction and difference have become private matters of the in-\ndividual.\n\nThis modern equality, based on the conformism inherent in\nsociety and possible only because behavior has replaced action as\nthe foremost mode of human relationship, is in every respect dif-\nferent from equality in antiquity, and notably in the Greek city-\nstates. To belong to the few “equals” (, homoioi ) meant to be per-\nmitted to live among one's peers; but the public realm itself, the\npolls, was permeated by a fiercely agonal spirit, where everybody\nhad constantly to distinguish himself from all others, to show\nthrough unique deeds or achievements that he was the best of all\n( aim ansteuein) , 34 The public realm, in other words, was reserved\nfor individuality; it was the only place where men could show\nwho they really and inexchangeably were. It was for the sake of\nthis chance, and out of love for a body politic that made it possible\nto them all, that each was more or less willing to share in the\nburden of jurisdiction, defense, and administration of public\naffairs.\n\nIt is the same conformism, the assumption that men behave and\n\n34. Aien aristeuein kai kypeirochon emmenai allon (“always to be the best and\nto rise above others”) is the central concern of Homer's heroes {Iliad vi. 208),\nand Homer was “the educator of Hellas.”\n\n[ 41 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndo not act with revSpect to each other, that lies at the root of the\nmodern science of economics, whose birth coincided with the rise\nof society and which, together with its chief technical tool, statis-\ntics, became the social science par excellence. Economics — until\nthe modern age a not too important part of ethics and politics and\nbased on the assumption that men act with respect to their econom-\nic activities as they act in every other respect 36 — could achieve a\nscientific character only when men had become social beings and\nunanimously followed certain patterns of behavior, so that those\nwho did not keep the rules could be considered to be asocial or\nabnormal.\n\nThe laws of statistics are valid only where large numbers or\nlong periods are involved, and acts or events can statistically\nappear only as deviations or fluctuations. The justification of sta-\ntistics is that deeds and events are rare occurrences in everyday\nlife and in history. Yet the meaningfulness of everyday relation-\nships is disclosed not in everyday life but in rare deeds, just as the\nsignificance of a historical period shows itself only in the few\nevents that illuminate it. The application of the law of large num-\nbers and long periods to politics or history signifies nothing less\nthan the wilful obliteration of their very subject matter, and it is\na hopeless enterprise to search for meaning in politics or signifi-\n\n3 5. “The conception of political economy as primarily a ‘science' dates only\nfrom Adam Smith” and was unknown not only to antiquity and the Middle Ages,\nbut also to canonist doctrine, the first “complete and economic doctrine” which\n“differed from modern economics in being an ‘art' rather than a ‘science' ”\n(W. J. Ashley, op. cit., pp. 379 ff.). Classical economics assumed that man, in so\nfar as he is an active being, acts exclusively from self-interest and is driven by\nonly one desire, the desire for acquisition. Adam Smith's introduction of an\n“invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of [anybody's] intention”\nproves that even this minimum of action with its uniform motivation still con-\ntains too much unpredictable initiative for the establishment of a science. Marx\ndeveloped classical economics further by substituting group or class interests for\nindividual and personal interests and by reducing these class interests to two ma-\njor classes, capitalists and workers, so that he was left with one conflict, where\nclassical economics had seen a multitude of contradictory conflicts. The reason\nwhy the Marxian economic system is more consistent and coherent, and there-\nfore apparently so much more “scientific” than those of his predecessors, lies\nprimarily in the construction of “socialized man,” who is even less an acting be-\ning than the “economic man” of liberal economics.\n\n[ V ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\ncance in history when everything that is not everyday behavior\nor automatic trends has been ruled out as immaterial.\n\nHowever, since the laws of statistics are perfectly valid where\nwe deal with large numbers, it is obvious that every increase in\npopulation means an increased validity and a marked decrease of\n“deviation.” Politically, this means that the larger the population\nin any given body politic, the more likely it will be the social\nrather than the political that constitutes the public realm. The\nGreeks, whose city-state was the most individualistic and least\nconformable body politic known to us, were quite aware of the\nfact that the polls , with its emphasis on action and speech, could\nsurvive only if the number of citizens remained restricted. Large\nnumbers of people, crowded together, develop an almost irresist-\nible inclination toward despotism, be this the despotism of a\nperson or of majority rule; and although statistics, that is, the\nmathematical treatment of reality, was unknown prior to the\nmodern age, the social phenomena which make such treatment\npossible — great numbers, accounting for conformism, behavior-\nism, and automatism in human affairs — were precisely those traits\nwhich, in Greek self-understanding, distinguished the Persian\ncivilization from their own.\n\nThe unfortunate truth about behaviorism and the validity of its\n“laws” is that the more people there are, the more likely they are\nto behave and the less likely to tolerate non-behavior. Statistically,\nthis will be shown in the leveling out of fluctuation. In reality,\ndeeds will have less and less chance to stem the tide of behavior,\nand events will more and more lose their significance, that is,\ntheir capacity to illuminate historical time. Statistical uniformity\nis by no means a harmless scientific ideal; it is the no longer\nsecret political ideal of a society which, entirely submerged in the\nroutine of everyday living, is at peace with the scientific outlook\ninherent in its very existence.\n\nThe uniform behavior that lends itself to statistical determina-\ntion, and therefore to scientifically correct prediction, can hardly\nbe explained by the liberal hypothesis of a natural “harmony of\ninterests,” the foundation of “classical” economics; it was not\nKarl Marx but the liberal economists themselves who had to in-\ntroduce the “communistic fiction,” that is, to assume that there is\n\n[ 43 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\none interest of society as a whole which with “an invisible hand”\nguides the behavior of men and produces the harmony of their\nconflicting interests . 36 The difference between Marx and his fore-\nrunners was only that he took the reality of conflict, as it pre-\nsented itself in the society of his time, as seriously as the hypo-\nthetical fiction of harmony; he was right in concluding that the\n“socialization of man” would produce automatically a harmony of\nall interests, and was only more courageous than his liberal teach-\ners when he proposed to establish in reality the “communistic fic-\ntion” underlying all economic theories. What Marx did not —\nand, at his time, could not— understand was that the germs of\ncommunistic society were present in the reality of a national\nhousehold, and that their full development was not hindered by\nany class-interest as such, but only by the already obsolete\nmonarchical structure of the nation-state. Obviously, what pre-\nvented society from smooth functioning was only certain tradi-\ntional remnants that interfered and still influenced the behavior\nof “backward” classes. From the viewpoint of society, these were\nmerely disturbing factors in the way of a full development of\n“social forces”; they no longer corresponded to reality and were\ntherefore, in a sense, much more “fictitious” than the scientific\n“fiction” of one interest.\n\nA complete victory of society will always produce some sort\nof “communistic fiction,” whose outstanding political characteris-\ntic is that it is indeed ruled by an “invisible hand,” namely, by\n\n36. That liberal utilitarianism, and not socialism, is “forced into an un-\ntenable ‘communistic fiction' about the unity of society” and that “the com-\nmunist fiction [is] implicit in most writings on economics” constitutes one of the\nchief theses of Myrdal's brilliant work (op. cit., pp. 54 and 150). He shows con-\nclusively that economics can be a science only if one assumes that one interest\npervades society as a whole. Behind the “harmony of interests” stands always\nthe “communistic fiction” of one interest, which may then be called welfare or\ncommonwealth. Liberal economists consequently were always guided by a\n“communistic” ideal, namely, by “interest of society as a whole” (pp. 194-95).\nThe crux of the argument is that this “amounts to the assertion that society\nmust be conceived as a single subject. This, however, is precisely what cannot be\nconceived. If we tried, we would be attempting to abstract from the essential\nfact that social activity is the result of the intentions of several individuals”\n(p. 154).\n\n\n[ 44 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nnobody. What we traditionally call state and government gives\nplace here to pure administration — a state of affairs which Marx\nrightly predicted as the “withering away of the state,” though he\nwas wrong in assuming that only a revolution could bring it about,\nand even more wrong when he believed that this complete victory\nof society would mean the eventual emergence of the “realm of\nfreedom .” 37\n\nTo gauge the extent of society's victory in the modern age, its\nearly substitution of behavior for action and its eventual substitu-\ntion of bureaucracy, the rule of nobody, for personal rulership, it\nmay be well to recall that its initial science of economics, which\nsubstitutes patterns of behavior only in this rather limited field of\nhuman activity, was finally followed by the all-comprehensive\npretension of the social sciences which, as “behavioral sciences,”\naim to reduce man as a whole, in all his activities, to the level of\na conditioned and behaving animal. If economics is the science of\nsociety in its early stages, when it could impose its rules of be-\nhavior only on sections of the population and on parts of their ac-\ntivities, the rise of the “behavioral sciences” indicates clearly the\nfinal stage of this development, when mass society has devoured\nall strata of the nation and “social behavior” has become the stand-\nard for all regions of life.\n\nSince the rise of society, since the admission of household and\nhousekeeping activities to the public realm, an irresistible tenden-\ncy to grow, to devour the older realms of the political and private\nas well as the more recently established sphere of intimacy, has\nbeen one of the outstanding characteristics of the new realm.This\nconstant growth, whose no less constant acceleration we can ob-\nserve over at least three centuries, derives its strength from the\nfact that through society it is the life process itself which in one\nform or another has been channeled into the public realm. The\nprivate realm of the household was the sphere where the necessi-\nties of life, of individual survival as well as of continuity of the\nspecies, were taken care of and guaranteed. One of the character-\n\n37. For a brilliant exposition of this usually neglected aspect of Marx's rele-\nvance for modern society, see Siegfried Landshut, “Die Gegenwart im Lichte der\nMarxschen Lehre,” Hamburger Jahrbuch fur Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftspolitik ,\n\n\n[ ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nistics of privacy, prior to the discovery of the intimate, was that\nman existed in this sphere not as a truly human being but only as\na specimen of the animal species man-kind. This, precisely, was\nthe ultimate reason for the tremendous contempt held for it by\nantiquity. The emergence of society has changed the estimate of\nthis whole sphere but has hardly transformed its nature. The\nmonolithic character of every type of society, its conformism\nwhich allows for only one interest and one opinion, is ultimately\nrooted in the one-ness of man-kind. It is because this one-ness of\nman-kind is not fantasy and not even merely a scientific hypothe-\nsis, as in the “communistic fiction” of classical economics, that\nmass society, where man as a social animal rules supreme and\nwhere apparently the survival of the species could be guaranteed\non a world-wide scale, can at the same time threaten humanity\nwith extinction.\n\nPerhaps the clearest indication that society constitutes the public\norganization of the life process itself may be found in the fact that\nin a relatively short time the new social realm transformed all\nmodern communities into societies of laborers and jobholders; in\nother words, they became at once centered around the one activity\nnecessary to sustain life. ( lb have a society of laborers, it is of\ncourse not necessary that every member actually be a laborer or\nworker — not even the emancipation of the working class and the\nenormous potential power which majority rule accords to it are\ndecisive here — but only that all members consider whatever they\ndo primarily as a way to sustain their own lives and those of their\nfamilies.) Society is the form in which the fact of mutual depend-\nence for the sake of life and nothing else assumes public signifi-\ncance and where the activities connected with sheer survival are\npermitted to appear in public.\n\nWhether an activity is performed in private or in public is by\nno means a matter of indifference. Obviously, the character of the\npublic realm must change in accordance with the activities admit-\nted into it, but to a large extent the activity itself changes its own\nnature too. The laboring activity, though under all circumstances\nconnected with the life process in its most elementary, biological\nsense, remained stationary for thousands of years, imprisoned in\nthe eternal recurrence of the life process to which it was tied. The\n\n[ 46 }\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nadmission of labor to public stature, far from eliminating its char-\nacter as a process — which one might have expected, remembering\nthat bodies politic have always been designed for permanence and\ntheir laws always understood as limitations imposed upon move-\nment — has, on the contrary, liberated this process from its cir-\ncular, monotonous recurrence and transformed it into a swiftly\nprogressing development whose results have in a few centuries\ntotally changed the whole inhabited world.\n\nThe moment laboring was liberated from the restrictions im-\nposed by its banishment into the private realm- and this emanci-\npation of labor was not a consequence of the emancipation of the\nworking class, but preceded it — it was as though the growth ele-\nment inherent in all organic life had completely overcome and\novergrown the processes of decay by which organic life is checked\nand balanced in nature's household. The social realm, where the\nlife process has established its own public domain, has let loose\nan unnatural growth, so to speak, of the natural; and it is against\nthis growth, not merely against society but against a constantly\ngrowing social realm, that the private and intimate, on the one\nhand, and the political (in the narrower sense of the word), on the\nother, have proved incapable of defending themselves.\n\nWhat we described as the unnatural growth of the natural is\nusually considered to be the constantly accelerated increase in the\nproductivity of labor. The greatest single factor in this constant\nincrease since its inception has been the organization of laboring,\nvisible in the so-called division of labor, which preceded the in-\ndustrial revolution; even the mechanization of labor processes,\nthe second greatest factor in labor's productivity, is based upon it.\nInasmuch as the organizational principle itself clearly derives from\nthe public rather than the private realm, division of labor is pre-\ncisely what happens to the laboring activity under conditions of\nthe public realm and what could never have happened in the privacy\nof the household . 38 In no other sphere of life do we appear to have\n\n38. Here and later I apply the term “division of labor” only to modern labor\nconditions where one activity is divided and atomized into innumerable minute\nmanipulations, and not to the “division of labor” given in professional specializa-\ntion. The latter can be so classified only under the assumption that society must\nbe conceived as one single subject, the fulfilment of whose needs are then sub-\n\n[ 4 ? ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nattained such excellence as in the revolutionary transformation of\nlaboring, and this to the point where the verbal significance of the\nword itself (which always had been connected with hardly bear-\nable “toil and trouble,” with effort and pain and, consequently,\nwith a deformation of the human body, so that only extreme\nmisery and poverty could be its source), has begun to lose its\nmeaning for us . 39 While dire necessity made labor indispensable\nto sustain life, excellence would have been the last thing to expect\nfrom it.\n\nExcellence itself, arete as the Greeks, virtus as the Romans\n\n\ndivided by “an invisible hand” among its members. The same holds true, mutatis\nmutandis, for the odd notion of a division of labor between the sexes, which is\neven considered by some writers to be the most original one. It presumes as its\nsingle subject man-kind, the human species, which has divided its labors among\nmen and women. Where the same argument is used in antiquity (see, for in-\nstance, Xenophon Oeconomicus vii. 22), emphasis and meaning are quite different.\nThe main division is between a life spent indoors, in the household, and a life\nspent outside, in the world. Only the latter is a life fully worthy of man, and the\nnotion of equality between man and woman, which is a necessary assumption for\nthe idea of division of labor, is of course entirely absent (cf. n. 81). Antiquity\nseems to have known only professional specialization, which assumedly was\npredetermined by natural qualities and gifts. Thus work in the gold mines, which\noccupied several thousand workers, was distributed according to strength and\nskill. See J.-P. Vernant, “Travail et nature dans la Grece ancienne,” Journal de\npsychologic normale et pathologique, Vol. LII, No. 1 (January-March, 1955).\n\n39. All the European words for “labor,” the Latin and English labor , the\nGreek ponos , the French travail, the German Arbeit , signify pain and effort and\nare also used for the pangs of birth. Labor has the same etymological root as\nlabare (“to stumble under a burden”) ; ponos and Arbeit have the same etymologi-\ncal roots as “poverty” ( penia in Greek and Armut in German). Even Hesiod,\ncurrently counted among the few defenders of labor in antiquity, put ponon algi-\nnoenta (“painful labor\") as first of the evils plaguing man (Theogony 226). For\nthe Greek usage, see G. Herzog-Hauser, “Ponos,'' in Pauly-Wissowa. The Ger-\nman Arbeit and arm are both derived from the Germanic arbma-, meaning lonely\nand neglected, abandoned. See Kluge/Gotze, Etymologisches Worterbuch (1951).\nIn medieval German, the word is used to translate labor, tribulatio, persecutio,\nadversitas , malum (see Klara Vontobel, Das Arbeitsethos des deutschen Protestant-\nismus [Dissertation, Bern, 1946]).\n\n[ 48 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nwould have called it, has always been assigned to the public realm\nwhere one could excel, could distinguish oneself from all others.\nEvery activity performed in public can attain an excellence never\nmatched in privacy; for excellence, by definition, the presence of\nothers is always required, and this presence needs the formality\nof the public, constituted by one's peers, it cannot be the casual,\nfamiliar presence of one's equals or inferiors . 40 Not even the social\nrealm — though it made excellence anonymous, emphasized the\nprogress of mankind rather than the achievements of men, and\nchanged the content of the public realm beyond recognition— has\nbeen able altogether to annihilate the connection between public per-\nformance and excellence. While we have become excellent in the la-\nboring we perform in public, our capacity for action and speech has\nlost much of its former quality since the rise of the social realm ban-\nished these into the sphere of the intimate and the private. This\ncurious discrepancy has not escaped public notice, where it is\nusually blamed upon an assumed time lag between our technical\ncapacities and our general humanistic development or between the\nphysical sciences, which change and control nature, and the social\nsciences, which do not yet know how to change and control\nsociety. Quite apart from other fallacies of the argument which\nhave been pointed out so frequently that we need not repeat them,\nthis criticism concerns only a possible change in the psychology\nof human beings — their so-called behavior patterns — not a change\nof the world they move in. And this psychological interpretation,\nfor which the absence or presence of a public realm is as irrelevant\nas any tangible, worldly reality, seems rather doubtful in view of\nthe fact that no activity can become excellent if the world does not\nprovide a proper space for its exercise. Neither education nor\ningenuity nor talent can replace the constituent elements of the\npublic realm, which make it the proper place for human excellence.\n\n40. Homer's much quoted thought that Zeus takes away half of a man's excel-\nlence (arete) when the day of slavery catches him ( Odyssey xvii. 320 ff.) is put\ninto the mouth of Eumaios, a slave himself, and meant as an objective state-\nment, not a criticism or a moral judgment. The slave lost excellence because he\nlost admission to the public realm, where excellence can show.\n\n[ 49 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n",
        "Section 7. THE PUBLIC REALM: THE COMMON": "\nThe term “public” signifies two closely interrelated but not alto-\ngether identical phenomena:\n\nIt means, first, that everything that appears in public can be\nseen and heard by everybody and has the widest possible publicity.\nFor us, appearance— something that is being seen and heard by\nothers as well as by ourselves — constitutes reality. Compared\nwith the reality which comes from being seen and heard, even the\ngreatest forces of intimate life — the passions of the heart, the\nthoughts of the mind, the delights of the senses— lead an uncer-\ntain, shadowy kind of existence unless and until they are trans-\nformed, deprivatized and deindividualized, as it were, into a shape\nto fit them for public appearance . 41 The most current of such\ntransformations occurs in storytelling and generally in artistic\ntransposition of individual experiences. But we do not need the\nform of the artist to witness this transfiguration. Each time we\ntalk about things that can be experienced only in privacy or in-\ntimacy, we bring them out into a sphere where they will assume\na kind of reality which, their intensity notwithstanding, they\nnever could have had before. The presence of others who see what\nwe see and hear what we hear assures us of the reality of the\nworld and ourselves, and while the intimacy of a fully developed\nprivate life, such as had never been known before the rise of the\nmodern age and the concomitant decline of the public realm, will\nalways greatly intensify and enrich the whole scale of subjective\nemotions and private feelings, this intensification will always come\nto pass at the expense of the assurance of the reality of the world\nand men.\n\nIndeed, the most intense feeling we know of, intense to the\npoint of blotting out all other experiences, namely, the experience\nof great bodily pain, is at the same time the most private and least\n\n41. This is also the reason why it is impossible “to write a character sketch\nof any slave who lived. . . . Until they emerge into freedom and notoriety, they\nremain shadowy types rather than persons” (Barrow, Slavery in the Roman\nEmpire , p. 156).\n\n\n[ so ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\ncommunicable of all. Not only is it perhaps the only experience\nwhich we are unable to transform into a shape fit for public appear-\nance, it actually deprives us of our feeling for reality to such an\nextent that we can forget it more quickly and easily than anything\nelse. There seems to be no bridge from the most radical subjec-\ntivity, in which I am no longer “recognizable,” to the outer world\nof life . 42 Pain, in other words, truly a borderline experience be-\ntween life as “being among men” ( inter homines esse ) and death,\nis so subjective and removed from the world of things and men\nthat it cannot assume an appearance at all . 43\n\nSince our feeling for reality depends utterly upon appearance\nand therefore upon the existence of a public realm into which\nthings can appear out of the darkness of sheltered existence, even\nthe twilight which illuminates our private and intimate lives is\nultimately derived from the much harsher light of the public\nrealm. Yet there are a great many things which cannot withstand\nthe implacable, bright light of the constant presence of others on\nthe public scene; there, only what is considered to be relevant,\nworthy of being seen or heard, can be tolerated, so that the irrele-\nvant becomes automatically a private matter. This, to be sure,\ndoes not mean that private concerns are generally irrelevant; on\nthe contrary, we shall see that there are very relevant matters\nwhich can survive only in the realm of the private. For instance,\nlove, in distinction from friendship, is killed, or rather extin-\nguished, the moment it is displayed in public. (“Never seek to tell\n\n42. I use here a little-known poem on pain from Rilke's deathbed: The first\nlines of the untitled poem are: “Komm du, du letzter, den ich anerkenne, / heil-\nloser Schmerz im leiblichen Geweb”; and it concludes as follows: “Bin ich es\nnoch, der da unkenntlich brennt? / Erinnerungen reiss ich nicht herein. / O Leben,\nLeben: Draussensein. / Und ich in Lohe, Niemand, der mich kennt.”\n\n43. On the subjectivity of pain and its relevance for all variations of hedonism\nand sensualism, see §§15 and 43. For the living, death is primarily dis-appear-\nance. But unlike pain, there is one aspect of death in which it is as though death\nappeared among the living, and that is in old age. Goethe once remarked that\ngrowing old is “gradually receding from appearance” (stufenweises Zuriicktreten\naus der Erscheinung) ; the truth of this remark as well as the actual appearance\nof this process of disappearing becomes quite tangible in the old-age self-portraits\nof the great masters — Rembrandt, Leonardo, etc. — in which the intensity of the\neyes seems to illuminate and preside over the receding flesh.\n\n[ n ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthy love / Love that never told can be.”) Because of its in-\nherent worldlessness, love can only become false and perverted\nwhen it is used for political purposes such as the change or sal-\nvation of the world.\n\nWhat the public realm considers irrelevant can have such an\nextraordinary and infectious charm that a whole people may adopt\nit as their way of life, without for that reason changing its essen-\ntially private character. Modern enchantment with “small things,”\nthough preached by early twentieth-century poetry in almost all\nEuropean tongues, has found its classical presentation in the petit\nbonheur of the French people. Since the decay of their once great\nand glorious public realm, the French have become masters in the\nart of being happy among “small things,” within the space of their\nown four walls, between chest and bed, table and chair, dog and\ncat and flowerpot, extending to these things a care and tenderness\nwhich, in a world where rapid industrialization constantly kills\noff the things of yesterday to produce today's objects, may even\nappear to be the world's last, purely humane corner. This enlarge-\nment of the private, the enchantment, as it were, of a whole people,\ndoes not make it public, does not constitute a public realm, but,\non the contrary, means only that the public realm has almost com-\npletely receded, so that greatness has given way to charm every-\nwhere; for while the public realm may be great, it cannot be\ncharming precisely because it is unable to harbor the irrelevant.\n\nSecond, the term “public” signifies the world itself, in so far\nas it is common to all of us and distinguished from our privately\nowned place in it. This world, however, is not identical with the\nearth or with nature, as the limited space for the movement of\nmen and the general condition of organic life. It is related, rather,\nto the human artifact, the fabrication of human hands, as well as\nto affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made\nworld together. To live together in the world means essentially\nthat a world of things is between those who have it in common,\nas a table is located between those who sit around it; the world,\nlike every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time.\n\nThe public realm, as the common world, gathers us together\nand yet prevents our falling over each other, so to speak. What\nmakes mass society so difficult to bear is not the number of people\n\n[ S2 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\ninvolved, or at least not primarily, but the fact that the world be-\ntween them has lost its power to gather them together, to relate\nand to separate them. The weirdness of this situation resembles a\nspiritualistic seance where a number of people gathered around a\ntable might suddenly, through some magic trick, see the table\nvanish from their midst, so that two persons sitting opposite each\nother were no longer separated but also would be entirely un-\nrelated to each other by anything tangible.\n\nHistorically, we know of only one principle that was ever de-\nvised to keep a community of people together who had lost their\ninterest in the common world and felt themselves no longer related\nand separated by it. To find a bond between people strong enough\nto replace the world was the main political task of early Christian\nphilosophy, and it was Augustine who proposed to found not only\nthe Christian “brotherhood” but all human relationships on chari-\nty. But this charity, though its worldlessness clearly corresponds\nto the general human experience of love, is at the same time clearly\ndistinguished from it in being something which, like the world, is\nbetween men: “Even robbers have between them [inter rr] what\nthey call charity .” 44 This surprising illustration of the Christian\npolitical principle is in fact very well chosen, because the bond of\ncharity between people, while it is incapable of founding a public\nrealm of its own, is quite adequate to the main Christian principle\nof worldlessness and is admirably fit to carry a group of essentially\nworldless people through the world, a group of saints or a group\nof criminals, provided only it is understood that the world itself\nis doomed and that every activity in it is undertaken with the pro-\nviso quamdiu mundus durat (“as long as the world lasts ”). 45 The\nunpolitical, non-public character of the Christian community was\nearly defined in the demand that it should form a corpus , a “body,”\nwhose members were to be related to each other like brothers of\nthe same family . 46 The structure of communal life was modeled\n\n44. Contra Faustum Manichaeum v. 5.\n\n45 . This is of course still the presupposition even of Aquinas' political philoso-\nphy (see op. cit. ii. 2. 181.4).\n\n46. The term corpus rei publicae is current in pre-Christian Latin, but has the\nconnotation of the population inhabiting a res publica , a given political realm. The\ncorresponding Greek term soma is never used in pre-Christian Greek in a political\n\n[ S3 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\non the relationships between the members of a family because\nthese were known to be non-political and even antipolitical. A\npublic realm had never come into being between the members of\na family, and it was therefore not likely to develop from Christian\ncommunity life if this life was ruled by the principle of charity and\nnothing else. Even then, as we know from the history and the\nrules of the monastic orders — the only communities in which the\nprinciple of charity as a political device was ever tried — the danger\nthat the activities undertaken under “the necessity of present life”\n\n( necessitas vitae praesentis ) 47 would lead by themselves, because they\nwere performed in the presence of others, to the establishment of\na kind of counterworld, a public realm within the orders them-\nselves, was great enough to require additional rules and regula-\ntions, the most relevant one in our context being the prohibition\nof excellence and its subsequent pride . 48\n\nWorldlessness as a political phenomenon is possible only on\nthe assumption that the world will not last; on this assumption,\nhowever, it is almost inevitable that worldlessness, in one form\nor another, will begin to dominate the political scene. This hap-\npened after the downfall of the Roman Empire and, albeit for\nquite other reasons and in very different, perhaps even more dis-\nconsolate forms, it seems to happen again in our own days. The\nChristian abstention from worldly things is by no means the only\nconclusion one can draw from the conviction that the human arti-\nfice, a product of mortal hands, is as mortal as its makers. This,\non the contrary, may also intensify the enjoyment and consump-\n\nsense. The metaphor seems to occur for the first time in Paul (I Cor. 12: 12-27)\nand is current in all early Christian writers (see, for instance, Tertullian Apolo-\ngeticus 39, or Ambrosius De officiis ministrorum iii. 3 . 1 7) . It became of the greatest\nimportance for medieval political theory, which unanimously assumed that all\nmen were quasi unum corpus (Aquinas op. cit. ii. 1. 81. 1). But while the early\nwriters stressed the equality of the members, which are all equally necessary for\nthe well-being of the body as a whole, the emphasis later shifted to the differ-\nence between the head and the members, to the duty of the head to rule and of\nthe members to obey. (For the Middle Ages, see Anton-Hermann Chroust, “The\nCorporate Idea in the Middle Ages,” Review of Politics, Vol. VIII [1947].)\n\n47. Aquinas op. cit. ii. 2. 179. 2.\n\n48. See Article 57 of the Benedictine rule, in Levasseur, op. cit., p. 187: If\none of the monks became proud of his work, he had to give it up.\n\n[ « ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\ntion of the things of the world, all manners of intercourse in which\nthe world is not primarily understood to be the koinon , that which\nis common to all. Only the existence of a public realm and the\nworld's subsequent transformation into a community of things\nwhich gathers men together and relates them to each other de-\npends entirely on permanence. If the world is to contain a public\nspace, it cannot be erected for one generation and planned for the\nliving only; it must transcend the life-span of mortal men.\n\nWithout this transcendence into a potential earthly immortali-\nty, no politics, strictly speaking, no common world and no public\nrealm, is possible. For unlike the common good as Christianity\nunderstood it — the salvation of one's soul as a concern common\nto all — the common world is what we enter when we are born\nand what we leave behind when we die. It transcends our life-\nspan into past and future alike; it was there before we came and\nwill outlast our brief sojourn in it. It is what we have in common\nnot only with those who live with us, but also with those who\nwere here before and with those who will come after us. But such\na common world can survive the coming and going of the genera-\ntions only to the extent that it appears in public. It is the publicity\nof the public realm which can absorb and make shine through the\ncenturies whatever men may want to save from the natural ruin\nof time. Through many ages before us— but now not any more-\nmen entered the public realm because they wanted something of\ntheir own or something they had in common with others to be more\npermanent than their earthly lives. (Thus, the curse of slavery\nconsisted not only in being deprived of freedom and of visibility,\nbut also in the fear of these obscure people themselves “that from\nbeing obscure they should pass away leaving no trace that they\nhave existed .”) 49 There is perhaps no clearer testimony to the\nloss of the public realm in the modern age than the almost complete\nloss of authentic concern with immortality, a loss somewhat over-\nshadowed by the simultaneous loss of the metaphysical concern\nwith eternity. The latter, being the concern of the philosophers\n\n49. Barrow ( Slavery in the Roman Empire, p. 168), in an illuminating discus-\nsion of the membership of slaves in the Roman colleges, which provided, besides\n“good fellowship in life and the certainty of a decent burial ... the crowning\nglory of an epitaph; and in this last the slave found a melancholy pleasure.”\n\n[ SS }\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nand the vita contemplativa , must remain outside our present con-\nsiderations. But the former is testified to by the current classifica-\ntion of striving for immortality with the private vice of vanity.\nUnder modern conditions, it is indeed so unlikely that anybody\nshould earnestly aspire to an earthly immortality that we proba-\nbly are justified in thinking it is nothing but vanity.\n\nThe famous passage in Aristotle, “Considering human affairs,\none must not . . . consider man as he is and not consider what is\nmortal in mortal things, but think about them [only] to the extent\nthat they have the possibility of immortalizing,” occurs very prop-\nerly in his political writings . 50 For the polls was for the Greeks,\nas the res publica was for the Romans, first of all their guarantee\nagainst the futility of individual life, the space protected against\nthis futility and reserved for the relative permanence, if not im-\nmortality, of mortals.\n\nWhat the modern age thought of the public realm, after the\nspectacular rise of society to public prominence, was expressed\nby Adam Smith when, with disarming sincerity, he mentions\n“that unprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters”\nfor whom “public admiration . . . makes always a part of their\nreward . . . , a considerable part ... in the profession of physic;\na still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it\nmakes almost the whole .” 51 Here it is self-evident that public\nadmiration and monetary reward are of the same nature and can\nbecome substitutes for each other. Public admiration, too, is\nsomething to be used and consumed, and status, as we would say\ntoday, fulfils one need as food fulfils another: public admiration\nis consumed by individual vanity as food is consumed by hunger.\nObviously, from this viewpoint the test of reality does not lie in\nthe public presence of others, but rather in the greater or lesser\nurgency of needs to whose existence or non-existence nobody can\never testify except the one who happens to suffer them. And\nsince the need for food has its demonstrable basis of reality in the\nlife process itself, it is also obvious that the entirely subjective\npangs of hunger are more real than “vainglory,” as Hobbes used\n\n50. Nkomachean Ethics 1 1 77b3 1 .\n\n51. Wealth of Nations, Book I, ch. 10 (pp. 120 and 95 of Vol. I of Every-\nman's ed.).\n\n\n[ n ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nto call the need for public admiration. Yet, even if these needs,\nthrough some miracle of sympathy, were shared by others, their\nvery futility would prevent their ever establishing anything so\nsolid and durable as a common world. The point then is not that\nthere is a lack of public admiration for poetry and philosophy in\nthe modern world, but that such admiration does not constitute a\nspace in which things are saved from destruction by time. The\nfutility of public admiration, which daily is consumed in ever\ngreater quantities, on the contrary, is such that monetary reward,\none of the most futile things there is, can become more “objective”\nand more real.\n\nAs distinguished from this “objectivity,” whose only basis is\nmoney as a common denominator for the fulfilment of all needs,\nthe reality of the public realm relies on the simultaneous presence\nof innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common\nworld presents itself and for which no common measurement or\ndenominator can ever be devised. For though the common world\nis the common meeting ground of all, those who are present have\ndifferent locations in it, and the location of one can no more coin-\ncide with the location of another than the location of two objects.\nBeing seen and being heard by others derive their significance\nfrom the fact that everybody sees and hears from a different posi-\ntion. This is the meaning of public life, compared to which even\nthe richest and most satisfying family life can offer only the pro-\nlongation or multiplication of one's own position with its attend-\ning aspects and perspectives. The subjectivity of privacy can be\nprolonged and multiplied in a family, it can even become so strong\nthat its weight is felt in the public realm; but this family “world”\ncan never replace the reality rising out of the sum total of aspects\npresented by one object to a multitude of spectators. Only where\nthings can be seen by many in a variety of aspects without chang-\ning their identity, so that those who are gathered around them\nknow they see sameness in utter diversity, can worldly reality\ntruly and reliably appear.\n\nUnder the conditions of a common world, reality is not guar-\nanteed primarily by the “common nature” of all men who con-\nstitute it, but rather by the fact that, differences of position and\nthe resulting variety of perspectives notwithstanding, everybody\n\n[ 57 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nis always concerned with the same object. If the sameness of the\nobject can no longer be discerned, no common nature of men, least\nof all the unnatural conformism of a mass society, can prevent the\ndestruction of the common world, which is usually preceded by\nthe destruction of the many aspects in which it presents itself to\nhuman plurality. This can happen under conditions of radical iso-\nlation, where nobody can any longer agree with anybody else, as\nis usually the case in tyrannies. But it may also happen under con-\nditions of mass society or mass hysteria, where we see all people\nsuddenly behave as though they were members of one family,\neach multiplying and prolonging the perspective of his neighbor.\nIn both instances, men have become entirely private, that is, they\nhave been deprived of seeing and hearing others, of being seen\nand being heard by them. They are all imprisoned in the subjec-\ntivity of their own singular experience, which does not cease to\nbe singular if the same experience is multiplied innumerable times.\nThe end of the common world has come when it is seen only under\none aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspec-\ntive.\n\n",
        "Section 8. THE PRIVATE REALM: PROPERTY": "\nIt is with respect to this multiple significance of the public realm\nthat the term “private,” in its original privative sense, has meaning.\nTo live an entirely private life means above all to be deprived of\nthings essential to a truly human life: to be deprived of the reality\nthat comes from being seen and heard by others, to be deprived\nof an “objective” relationship with them that comes from being\nrelated to and separated from them through the intermediary of\na common world of things, to be deprived of the possibility of\nachieving something more permanent than life itself. The priva-\ntion of privacy lies in the absence of others; as far as they are\nconcerned, private man does not appear, and therefore it is as\nthough he did not exist. Whatever he does remains without sig-\nnificance and consequence to others, and what matters to him is\nwithout interest to other people.\n\nUnder modern circumstances, this deprivation of “objective”\n\n[ 58 ]\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nrelationships to others and of a reality guaranteed through them\nhas become the mass phenomenon of loneliness, where it has as-\nsumed its most extreme and most antihuman form . 62 The reason\nfor this extremity is that mass society not only destroys the\npublic realm but the private as well, deprives men not only of\ntheir place in the world but of their private home, where they\nonce felt sheltered against the world and where, at any rate, even\nthose excluded from the world could find a substitute in the\nwarmth of the hearth and the limited reality of family life. The\nfull development of the life of hearth and family into an inner and\nprivate space we owe to the extraordinary political sense of the\nRoman people who, unlike the Greeks, never sacrificed the private\nto the public, but on the contrary understood that these two realms\ncould exist only in the form of coexistence. And although the\nconditions of slaves probably were hardly better in Rome than in\nAthens, it is quite characteristic that a Roman writer should have\nbelieved that to slaves the household of the master was what the\nres publica was to citizens . 53 Yet no matter how bearable private\nlife in the family might have been, it could obviously never be\nmore than a substitute, even though the private realm in Rome\nas in Athens offered plenty of room for activities which we today\nclass higher than political activity, such as the accumulation of\nwealth in Greece or the devotion to art and science in Rome.\nThis “liberal” attitude, which could under certain circumstances\nresult in very prosperous and highly educated slaves, meant only\nthat to be prosperous had no reality in the Greek polls and to be\na philosopher was without much consequence in the Roman\nrepublic . 64\n\n52. For modern loneliness as a mass phenomenon see David Riesman, The\nLonely Crowd (1950).\n\n53. So Plinius Junior, quoted in W. I.. Westermann, “Sklaverei,” in Pauly-\nWissowa, Suppl. VI, p, 1045.\n\n54. There is plenty of evidence for this different estimation of wealth and cul-\nture in Rome and Greece. But it is interesting to note how consistently this esti-\nmate coincided with the position of slaves. Roman slaves played a much greater\nrole in Roman culture than in Greece, where, on the other hand, their role in\neconomic life was much more important (see Westermann, in Pauly-Wissowa,\np. 984).\n\n\n[ S9 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nIt is a matter of course that the privative trait of privacy, the\nconsciousness of being deprived of something essential in a life\nspent exclusively in the restricted sphere of the household, should\nhave been weakened almost to the point of extinction by the rise\nof Christianity. Christian morality, as distinguished from its fun-\ndamental religious precepts, has always insisted that everybody\nshould mind his own business and that political responsibility\nconstituted first of all a burden, undertaken exclusively for the\nsake of the well-being and salvation of those it freed from worry\nabout public affairs . 66 It is surprising that this attitude should have\nsurvived into the secular modern age to such an extent that Karl\nMarx, who in this as in other respects only summed up, concep-\ntualized, and transformed into a program the underlying assump-\ntions of two hundred years of modernity, could eventually predict\nand hope for the “withering away” of the whole public realm. The\ndifference between the Christian and socialist viewpoints in this\nrespect, the one viewing government as a necessary evil because\nof man's sinfulness and the other hoping to abolish it eventually,\nis not a difference in estimate of the public sphere itself, but of\nhuman nature. What is impossible to perceive from either point\nof view is that Marx's “withering away of the state” had been\npreceded by a withering away of the public realm, or rather by\nits transformation into a very restricted sphere of government; in\nMarx's day, this government had already begun to wither further,\nthat is, to be transformed into a nation-wide “housekeeping,”\nuntil in our own day it has begun to disappear altogether into the\neven more restricted, impersonal sphere of administration.\n\nIt seems to be in the nature of the relationship between the\npublic and private realms that the final stage of the disappearance\n\n55. Augustine ( De civitate Dei xix. 19) sees in the duty of caritas toward the\nutilitas proximi (“the interest of one's neighbor”) the limitation of otium and\ncontemplation. But “in active life, it is not the honors or power of this life we\nshould covet, ... but the welfare of those who are under us [ salutem subdi-\ntorurri\\y Obviously, this kind of responsibility resembles the responsibility of\nthe household head for his family more than political responsibility, properly\nspeaking. The Christian precept to mind one's own business is derived from\nI Thess. 4:11: “that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business” ( prattein\nta idia, whereby ta idia is understood as opposed to ta koina [“public common\naffairs”]).\n\n\n[ 60 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nof the public realm should be accompanied by the threatened\nliquidation of the private realm as well. Nor is it an accident that\nthe whole discussion has eventually turned into an argument about\nthe desirability or undesirability of privately owned property. For\nthe word “private” in connection with property, even in terms of\nancient political thought, immediately loses its privative charac-\nter and much of its opposition to the public realm in general;\nproperty apparently possesses certain qualifications which,\nthough lying in the private realm, were always thought to be of\nutmost importance to the political body.\n\nThe profound connection between private and public, manifest\non its most elementary level in the question of private property, is\nlikely to be misunderstood today because of the modern equation\nof property and wealth on one side and propertylessness and\npoverty on the other. This misunderstanding is all the more annoy-\ning as both, property as well as wealth, are historically of greater\nrelevance to the public realm than any other private matter or\nconcern and have played, at least formally, more or less the same\nrole as the chief condition for admission to the public realm and\nfull-fledged citizenship. It is therefore easy to forget that wealth\nand property, far from being the same, are of an entirely different\nnature. The present emergence everywhere of actually or poten-\ntially very wealthy societies which at the same time are essentially\npropertyless, because the wealth of any single individual consists\nof his share in the annual income of society as a whole, clearly\nshows how little these two things are connected.\n\nPrior to the modern age, which began with the expropriation\nof the poor and then proceeded to emancipate the new propertyless\nclasses, all civilizations have rested upon the sacredness of private\nproperty. Wealth, on the contrary, whether privately owned or\npublicly distributed, had never been sacred before. Originally,\nproperty meant no more or less than to have one's location in a\nparticular part of the world and therefore to belong to the body\npolitic, that is, to be the head of one of the families which together\nconstituted the public realm. This piece of privately owned world\nwas so completely identical with the family who owned it 66 that\n\n56. Coulanges (op. cit .) holds: “The true signification of familia is property;\nit designates the field, the house, money, and slaves” (p. 107). Yet, this “prop-\n\n[ 61 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe expulsion of a citizen could mean not merely the confiscation\nof his estate but the actual destruction of the building itself . 57 The\nwealth of a foreigner or a slave was under no circumstances a\nsubstitute for this property , 68 and poverty did not deprive the\nhead of a family of this location in the world and the citizenship\nresulting from it. In early times, if he happened to lose his loca-\ntion, he almost automatically lost his citizenship and the protec-\ntion of the law as well . 69 The sacredness of this privacy was like\nthe sacredness of the hidden, namely, of birth and death, the begin-\nning and end of the mortals who, like all living creatures, grow\nout of and return to the darkness of an underworld . 60 The non-\nprivative trait of the household realm originally lay in its being\nthe realm of birth and death which must be hidden from the public\nrealm because it harbors the things hidden from human eyes and\n\n\nerty” is not seen as attached to the family; on the contrary, “the family is at-\ntached to the hearth, the hearth is attached to the soil” (p. 62). The point is:\n“The fortune is immovable like the hearth and the tomb to which it is attached.\nIt is the man who passes away” (p. 74).\n\n57. Levasseur {op. cit .) relates the medieval foundation of a community and\nthe conditions of admission to it: “II ne suffisait pas d'habiter la ville pour avoir\ndroit a cette admission. II fallait . . . posseder une maison. . . .” Furthermore:\n“Toute injure proferee en public contre la commune entramait la demolition de\nla maison et le bannissement du coupable” (p. 240, including n. 3).\n\n58. The distinction is most obvious in the case of slaves who, though without\nproperty in the ancient understanding (that is, without a place of their own), were\nby no means propertyless in the modem sense. The feculium (the “private posses-\nsion of a slave”) could amount to considerable sums and even contain slaves of his\nown ( vicarii ). Barrow speaks of “the property which the humblest of his class\npossessed” ( Slavery in the Roman Empire , p. 122; this work is the best report on\nthe role of the feculium) .\n\n59. Coulanges reports a remark of Aristotle that in ancient times the son\ncould not be a citizen during the lifetime of his father; upon his death, only the\neldest son enjoyed political rights {of. cit., p. 228). Coulanges holds that the\nRoman flebs originally consisted of people without home and hearth, that it there-\nfore was clearly distinct from the populus Romanus (pp. 229 ff.) .\n\n60. “The whole of this religion was inclosed within the walls of each house.\n. . . All these gods, the Hearth, the Lares, and the Manes, were called the hidden\ngods, or gods of the interior. To all the acts of this religion secrecy was necessary,\nsacrificia occulta, as Cicero said (De arusp. respl. 17)” (Coulanges, op. cit., p. 37).\n\n[ 62 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nimpenetrable to human knowledge . 61 It is hidden because man\ndoes not know where he comes from when he is born and where\nhe goes when he dies.\n\nNot the interior of this realm, which remains hidden and of no\npublic significance, but its exterior appearance is important for\nthe city as well, and it appears in the realm of the city through\nthe boundaries between one household and the other. The law\noriginally was identified with this boundary line , 62 which in an-\ncient times was still actually a space, a kind of no man's land 63\nbetween the private and the public, sheltering and protecting both\nrealms while, at the same time, separating them from each other.\nThe law of the polls, to be sure, transcended this ancient under-\nstanding from which, however, it retained its original spatial sig-\nnificance. The law of the city-state was neither the content of\npolitical action (the idea that political activity is primarily legis-\nlating, though Roman in origin, is essentially modern and found\nits greatest expession in Kant's political philosophy) nor was it a\ncatalogue of prohibitions, resting, as all modern laws still do, upon\nthe Thou Shalt Nots of the Decalogue. It was quite literally a\n\n61. It seems as though the Eleusinian Mysteries provided for a common and\nquasi-public experience of this whole realm, which, because of its very nature and\neven though it was common to all, needed to be hidden, kept secret from the\npublic realm: Everybody could participate in them, but nobody was permitted\nto talk about them. The mysteries concerned the unspeakable, and experiences\nbeyond speech were non-political and perhaps antipolitical by definition (see\nKarl Kerenyi, Die Geburt der Helena [1943-45], pp. 48 ff.). That they concerned\nthe secret of birth and death seems proved by a fragment of Pindar: oide'men\nbiou teleutm , oiden de diosdoton archan (frag. 137a), where the initiated is said to\nknow “the end of life and the Zeus-given beginning.”\n\n62. The Greek word for law, nomos, derives from nemein, which means to\ndistribute, to possess (what has been distributed), and to dwell. The combination\nof law and hedge in the word nomos is quite manifest in a fragment of Heraclitus:\nmachesthai chre ton demon hyper ton nomou hokosper teicheos (“the people should\nfight for the law as for a wall”). The Roman word for law, lex , has an entirely\ndifferent meaning; it indicates a formal relationship between people rather than\nthe wall that separates them from others. But the boundary and its god, Terminus,\nwho separated the agrum publicum a privato (Livius) was more highly revered\nthan the corresponding theoi horoi in Greece.\n\n63. Coulanges reports an ancient Greek law according to which two build-\nings never were permitted to touch {op. cit., p. 63) .\n\n[ 63 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwall, without which there might have been an agglomeration of\nhouses, a town ( asty ), but not a city, a political community. This\nwall-like law was sacred, but only the inclosure was political . 64\nWithout it a public realm could no more exist than a piece of\nproperty without a fence to hedge it in; the one harbored and\ninclosed political life as the other sheltered and protected the\nbiological life process of the family . 66\n\nIt is therefore not really accurate to say that private property,\nprior to the modern age, was thought to be a self-evident condi-\ntion for admission to the public realm; it is much more than that.\nPrivacy was like the other, the dark and hidden side of the public\nrealm, and while to be political meant to attain the highest possi-\nbility of human existence, to have no private place of one's own\n(like a slave) meant to be no longer human.\n\nOf an altogether different and historically later origin is the\npolitical significance of private wealth from which one draws the\nmeans of one's livelihood. We mentioned earlier the ancient iden-\ntification of necessity with the private realm of the household,\nwhere each had to master the necessities of life for himself. The\nfree man, who disposed of his own privacy and was not, like a\nslave, at the disposition of a master, could still be “forced” by\npoverty. Poverty forces the free man to act like a slave . 66 Private\nwealth, therefore, became a condition for admission to public life\nnot because its owner was engaged in accumulating it but, on the\ncontrary, because it assured with reasonable certainty that its\nowner would not have to engage in providing for himself the\n\n64. The word polis originally connoted something like a “ring-wall,” and it\nseems the Latin mbs also expressed the notion of a “circle” and was derived from\nthe same root as orbis. We find the same connection in our word “town,” which\noriginally, like the German Zaun , meant a surrounding fence (see R. B. Onians,\nThe Origins of European Thought [1954], p. 444, n. 1).\n\n65. The legislator therefore did not need to be a citizen and frequently was\ncalled in from the outside. His work was not political; political life, however,\ncould begin only after he had finished his legislation.\n\n66. Demosthenes Orationes 57. 45: “Poverty forces the free to do many\nslavish and base things” ( polla doulika kai tapeim pragmata torn eleutherous he penia\nbiazetai poieiri) .\n\n\n[ 64 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nmeans of use and consumption and was free for public activity . 67\nPublic life, obviously, was possible only after the much more\nurgent needs of life itself had been taken care of. The means to\ntake care of them was labor, and the wealth of a person therefore\nwas frequently counted in terms of the number of laborers, that\nis, slaves, he owned . 68 To own property meant here to be master\nover one's own necessities of life and therefore potentially to be\na free person, free to transcend his own life and enter the world\nall have in common.\n\nOnly with the emergence of such a common world in concrete\ntangibility, that is, with the rise of the city-state, could this kind\nof private ownership acquire its eminent political significance, and\nit is therefore almost a matter of course that the famous “disdain\nfor menial occupations” is not yet to be found in the Homeric\nworld. If the property-owner chose to enlarge his property in-\nstead of using it up in leading a political life, it was as though he\nwillingly sacrificed his freedom and became voluntarily what the\nslave was against his own will, a servant of necessity . 69\n\n67. This condition for admission to the public realm was still in existence in\nthe earlier Middle Ages. The English “Books of Customs” still drew “a sharp\ndistinction between the craftsman and the freeman, franke homme, of the town.\n... If a craftsman became so rich that he wished to become a freeman, he must\nfirst foreswear his craft and get rid of all his tools from his house” (W. J. Ashley,\nop. cit., p. 83). It was only under the rule of Edward III that the craftsmen be-\ncame so rich that “instead of the craftsmen being incapable of citizenship, citizen-\nship came to be bound up with membership of one of the companies” (p. 89).\n\n68. Coulanges, in distinction from other authors, stresses the time- and\nstrength-consuming activities demanded from an ancient citizen, rather than his\n“leisure,” and sees rightly that Aristotle's statement that no man who had to\nwork for his livelihood could be a citizen is a simple statement of fact rather than\nthe expression of a prejudice (op. cit., pp. 335 ff.). It is characteristic of the mod-\nern development that riches as such, regardless of the occupation of their owner,\nbecame a qualification for citizenship: only now was it a mere privilege to be a\ncitizen, unconnected with any specifically political activities.\n\n69. This seems to me to be the solution of the “well-known puzzle in the\nstudy of the economic history of the ancient world that industry developed up to\na certain point, but stopped short of making progress which might have been ex-\npected ... [in view of the fact that] thoroughness and capacity for organization\non a large scale is shown by the Romans in other departments, in the public\nservices and the army” (Barrow, Slavery in the Romm Empire, pp. 109-10) . It\n\n[ 65 1\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nUp to the beginning of the modern age, this kind of property\nhad never been held to be sacred, and only where wealth as the\nsource of income coincided with the piece of land on which a\nfamily was located, that is, in an essentially agricultural society,\ncould these two types of property coincide to such an extent that\nall property assumed the character of sacredness. Modern advo-\ncates of private property, at any rate, who unanimously under-\nstand it as privately owned wealth and nothing else, have little\ncause to appeal to a tradition according to which there could be\nno free public realm without a proper establishment and protection\nof privacy. For the enormous and still proceeding accumulation of\nwealth in modern society, which was started by expropriation—\nthe expropriation of the peasant classes which in turn was the\nalmost accidental consequence of the expropriation of Church and\nmonastic property after the Reformation 70 — has never shown\n\n\nseems a prejudice due to modem conditions to expect the same capacity for or-\nganization in private as in “public services.” Max Weber, in his remarkable essay\n{op. cit.) had already insisted on the fact that ancient cities were rather “centers\nof consumption than of production” and that the ancient slave owner was a\n“rentier and not a capitalist [ Untemehmer ]” (pp. 13, 22 ff., and 144). The very\nindifference of ancient writers to economic questions, and the lack of documents\nin this respect, give additional weight to Weber's argument.\n\n70. All histories of the working class, that is, a class of people who are with-\nout any property and live only from the work of their hands, suffer from the\nnaive assumption that there has always been such a class. Yet, as we saw, even\nslaves were not without property in antiquity, and the so-called free labor in an-\ntiquity usually turns out to consist of “free shopkeepers, traders and craftsmen”\n(Barrow, Slavery in the Roman Empire , p. 126). M. E. Park ( The Plebs Urbana\nin Cicero's Day [1921]), therefore, comes to the conclusion that there was no free\nlabor, since the free man always appears to be an owner of some sort. W. J.\nAshley sums up the situation in the Middle Ages up to the fifteenth century:\n“There was as yet no large class of wage laborers, no ‘working class' in the mod-\nern sense of the term. By ‘working men,' we mean a number of men, from among\nwhom individuals may indeed rise to become masters, but the majority of whom\ncannot hope ever to rise to a higher position. But in the fourteenth century a few\nyears' work as a journeyman was but a stage through which the poorer men had\nto pass, while the majority probably set up for themselves as master craftsmen\nas soon as apprenticeship was over” {op. cit., pp. 93-94).\n\nThus, the working class in antiquity was neither free nor without property;\nif, through manumission, the slave was given (in Rome) or had bought (in\n\nr 66 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nmuch consideration for private property but has sacrificed it\nwhenever it came into conflict with the accumulation of wealth.\nProudhon's dictum that property is theft has a solid basis of truth\nin the origins of modern capitalism; it is all the more significant\nthat even Proudhon hesitated to accept the doubtful remedy of\ngeneral expropriation, because he knew quite well that the aboli-\ntion of private property, while it might cure the evil of poverty,\nwas only too likely to invite the greater evil of tyranny . 71 Since\nhe did not distinguish between property and wealth, his two in-\nsights appear in his work like contradictions, which in fact they\nare not. Individual appropriation of wealth will in the long run\nrespect private property no more than socialization of the ac-\ncumulation process. It is not an invention of Karl Marx but\nactually in the very nature of this society itself that privacy in\nevery sense can only hinder the development of social “produc-\ntivity” and that considerations of private ownership therefore\nshould be overruled in favor of the ever-increasing process of\nsocial wealth . 72\n\n\nAthens) his freedom, he did not become a free laborer but instantly became an\nindependent businessman or craftsman. (“Most slaves seem to have taken into\nfreedom some capital of their own” to set up in trade and industry [Barrow,\nSlavery in the Roman Empire , p. 103]). And in the Middle Ages, to be a worker\nin the modern sense of the term was a temporary stage in one's life, a preparation\nfor mastership and manhood. Hired labor in the Middle Ages was an exception,\nand the German day laborers (the Tagelohner in Luther's Bible translation) or the\nFrench manoeuvres lived outside the settled communities and were identical with\nthe poor, the “labouring poor” in England (see Pierre Brizon, Histoire du travail\net des travailleurs [1926], p. 40). Moreover, the fact that no code of law before\nthe Code Napoleon offers any treatment of free labor (see W. Endemann, Die\nBehandlung der Arbeit im Privatrecht [1896], pp. 49, 53) shows conclusively how\nrecent the existence of a working class is.\n\n71 . See the ingenious comment on “property is theft\" -which occurs in Prou-\ndhon's posthumously published Theorie de lapropriete,pp. 209-10, where he pre-\nsents property in its “egoist, satanic nature” as the “most efficient means to re-\nsist despotism without overthrowing the state.”\n\n72. I must confess that I fail to see on what grounds in present-day society\nliberal economists (who today call themselves conservatives) can justify their\noptimism that the private appropriation of wealth will suffice to guard individual\nliberties — that is, will fulfil the same role as private property.

        "Section 9. THE SOCIAL AND THE PRIVATE": "\nWhat we called earlier the rise of the social coincided historically\nwith the transformation of the private care for private property\ninto a public concern. Society, when it first entered the public\nrealm, assumed the disguise of an organization of property-owners\nwho, instead of claiming access to the public realm because of\ntheir wealth, demanded protection from it for the accumulation\nof more wealth. In the words of Bodin, government belonged to\nkings and property to subjects, so that it was the duty of the kings\nto rule in the interest of their subjects' property. “The common-\nwealth,” as has recently been pointed out, “largely existed for\nthe common wealth.” 7 *\n\nWhen this common wealth, the result of activities formerly\nbanished to the privacy of the households, was permitted to take\nover the public realm, private possessions — which are essentially\nmuch less permanent and much more vulnerable to the mortality\nof their owners than the common world, which always grows out\nof the past and is intended to last for future generations — began\nto undermine the durability of the world. It is true that wealth\ncan be accumulated to a point where no individual life-span can\nuse it up, so that the family rather than the individual becomes\nits owner. Yet wealth remains something to be used and consumed\nno matter how many individual life-spans it may sustain. Only\nwhen wealth became capital, whose chief function was to gen-\nerate more capital, did private property equal or come close to\nthe permanence inherent in the commonly shared world . 74 How-\n\nsociety, these liberties are safe only as long as they are guaranteed by the state,\nand even now they are constantly threatened, not by the state, but by society,\nwhich distributes the jobs and determines the share of individual appropriation.\n\n73. R. W. K. Hinton, “Was Charles I a Tyrant?” Review of Politics, Vol.\nXVIII (January, 1956).\n\n74. For the history of the word “capital” deriving from the Latin caput,\nwhich in Roman law was employed for the principal of a debt, see W. J. Ashley,\nop. cit., pp. 429 and 433, n. 183. Only eighteenth-century writers began to use\nthe word in the modern sense as “wealth invested in such a way as to bring gain.”\n\n[ 68 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\never, this permanence is of a different nature; it is the permanence\nof a process rather than the permanence of a stable structure.\nWithout the process of accumulation, wealth would at once fall\nback into the opposite process of disintegration through use and\nconsumption.\n\nCommon wealth, therefore, can never become common in the\nsense we speak of a common world; it remained, or rather was\nintended to remain, strictly private. Only the government, ap-\npointed to shield the private owners from each other in the com-\npetitive struggle for more wealth, was common. The obvious\ncontradiction in this modern concept of government, where the\nonly thing people have in common is their private interests, need\nno longer bother us as it still bothered Marx, since we know that\nthe contradiction between private and public, typical of the initial\nstages of the modern age, has been a temporary phenomenon\nwhich introduced the utter extinction of the very difference be-\ntween the private and public realms, the submersion of both in\nthe sphere of the social. By the same token, we are in a far better\nposition to realize the consequences for human existence when\nboth the public and private spheres of life are gone, the public\nbecause it has become a function of the private and the private\nbecause it has become the only common concern left.\n\nSeen from this viewpoint, the modern discovery of intimacy\nseems a flight from the whole outer world into the inner subjec-\ntivity of the individual, which formerly had been sheltered and\nprotected by the private realm. The dissolution of this realm into\nthe social may most conveniently be watched in the progressing\ntransformation of immobile into mobile property until eventually\nthe distinction between property and wealth, between the fun-\ngibiles and the consumpti biles of Roman law, loses all significance\nbecause every tangible, “fungible” thing has become an object of\n“consumption”; it lost its private use value which was determined\nby its location and acquired an exclusively social value determined\nthrough its ever-changing exchangeability whose fluctuation could\nitself be fixed only temporarily by relating it to the common de-\nnominator of money . 76 Closely connected with this social evapora-\n\n75. Medieval economic theory did not yet conceive of money as a common\ndenominator and yardstick but counted it among the consumptibiles.\n\n[ 69 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntion of the tangible was the most revolutionary modern contribu-\ntion to the concept of property, according to which property was\nnot a fixed and firmly located part of the world acquired by its\nowner in one way or another but, on the contrary, had its source\nin man himself, in his possession of a body and his indisputable\nownership of the strength of this body, which Marx called “labor-\npower.”\n\nThus modern property lost its worldly character and was lo-\ncated in the person himself, that is, in what an individual could\nlose only along with his life. Historically, Locke's assumption\nthat the labor of one's body is the origin of property is more than\ndoubtful; but in view of the fact that we already live under condi-\ntions where our only reliable property is our skill and our labor\npower, it is more than likely that it will become true. For wealth,\nafter it became a public concern, has grown to such proportions\nthat it is almost unmanageable by private ownership. It is as\nthough the public realm had taken its revenge against those who\ntried to use it for their private interests. The greatest threat here,\nhowever, is not the abolition of private ownership of wealth but\nthe abolition of private property in the sense of a tangible, worldly\nplace of one's own.\n\nIn order to understand the danger to human existence from the\nelimination of the private realm, for which the intimate is not a\nvery reliable substitute, it may be best to consider those non-\nprivative traits of privacy which are older than, and independent\nof, the discovery of intimacy. The difference between what we\nhave in common and what we own privately is first that our\nprivate possessions, which we use and consume daily, are much\nmore urgently needed than any part of the common world; with-\nout property, as Locke pointed out, “the common is of no use .” 76\nThe same necessity that, from the standpoint of the public realm,\nshows only its negative aspect as a deprivation of freedom pos-\nsesses a driving force whose urgency is unmatched by the so-\ncalled higher desires and aspirations of man; not only will it\nalways be the first among man's needs and worries, it will also\nprevent the apathy and disappearance of initiative which so obvi-\n\n76. Second Treatise of Civil Government , sec. 27.\n\n[ 70 ]\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nously threatens all overly wealthy communities . 77 Necessity and\nlife are so intimately related and connected that life itself is\nthreatened where necessity is altogether eliminated. For the\nelimination of necessity, far from resulting automatically in the\nestablishment of freedom, only blurs the distinguishing line be-\ntween freedom and necessity. (Modern discussions of freedom,\nwhere freedom is never understood as an objective state of human\nexistence but either presents an unsolvable problem of subjectivity,\nof an entirely undetermined or determined will, or develops out\nof necessity, all point to the fact that the objective, tangible differ-\nence between being free and being forced by necessity is no longer\nperceived.)\n\nThe second outstanding non-privative characteristic of privacy\nis that the four walls of one's private property offer the only reli-\nable hiding place from the common public world, not only from\neverything that goes on in it but also from its very publicity, from\nbeing seen and being heard. A life spent entirely in public, in the\npresence of others, becomes, as we would say, shallow. While it\nretains its visibility, it loses the quality of rising into sight from\nsome darker ground which must remain hidden if it is not to lose\nits depth in a very real, non-subjective sense. The only efficient\nway to guarantee the darkness of what needs to be hidden against\nthe light of publicity is private property, a privately owned place\nto hide in . 78\n\nWhile it is only natural that the non-privative traits of privacy\nshould appear most clearly when men are threatened with depriva-\ntion of it, the practical treatment of private property by premod-\nern political bodies indicates clearly that men have always been\nconscious of their existence and importance. This, however, did\nnot make them protect the activities in the private realm directly,\nbut rather the boundaries separating the privately owned from\nother parts of the world, most of all from the common world itself.\nThe distinguishing mark of modem political and economic theory,\n\n77. The relatively few instances of ancient authors praising labor and poverty\nare inspired by this danger (for references see G. Herzog-Hauser, op. cit.) .\n\n78. The Greek and Latin words for the interior of the house, megaron and\natrium, have a strong connotation of darkness and blackness (see Mommsen,\nop. cit., pp. 22 and 236).\n\n\n[ 71 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\non the other hand, in so far as it regards private property as a\ncrucial issue, has been its stress upon the private activities of\nproperty -owners and their need of government protection for the\nsake of accumulation of wealth at the expense of the tangible\nproperty itself. What is important to the public realm, however,\nis not the more or less enterprising spirit of private businessmen\nbut the fences around the houses and gardens of citizens. The\ninvasion of privacy by society, the “socialization of man” (Marx),\nis most efficiently carried through by means of expropriation, but\nthis is not the only way. Here, as in other respects, the revolu-\ntionary measures of socialism or communism can very well be\nreplaced by a slower and no less certain “withering away” of the\nprivate realm in general and of private property in particular.\n\nThe distinction between the private and public realms, seen\nfrom the viewpoint of privacy rather than of the body politic,\nequals the distinction between things that should be shown and\nthings that should be hidden. Only the modern age, in its rebellion\nagainst society, has discovered how rich and manifold the realm\nof the hidden can be under the conditions of intimacy; but it is\nstriking that from the beginning of history to our own time it has\nalways been the bodily part of human existence that needed to be\nhidden in privacy, all things connected with the necessity of the\nlife process itself, which prior to the modern age comprehended\nall activities serving the subsistence of the individual and the sur-\nvival of the species. Hidden away were the laborers who “with\ntheir bodies minister to the [bodily] needs of life ,” 79 and the\nwomen who with their bodies guarantee the physical survival of\nthe species. Women and slaves belonged to the same category and\nwere hidden away not only because they were somebody else's\nproperty but because their life was “laborious,” devoted to bodily\nfunctions . 80 In the beginning of the modern age, when “free”\n\n79. Aristode Politics 1254b2J.\n\n80. The life of a woman is called ponetikos by Aristotle, On the Generation of\nAnimals 77 5a3 3 . That women and slaves belonged and lived together, that no\nwoman, not even the wife of the household head, lived among her equals — other\nfree women— so that rank depended much less on birth than on “occupation” or\nfunction, is very well presented by Wallon {op. cit., I, 77 ff.), who speaks of a\n“confusion des rangs, ce partage de toutes les fonctions domestiques” : “Les\n\n[ 72 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nlabor had lost its hiding place in the privacy of the household, the\nlaborers were hidden away and segregated from the community\nlike criminals behind high walls and under constant supervision . 81\nThe fact that the modern age emancipated the working classes\nand the women at nearly the same historical moment must cer-\ntainly be counted among the characteristics of an age which no\nlonger believes that bodily functions and material concerns should\nbe hidden. It is all the more symptomatic of the nature of these\nphenomena that the few remnants of strict privacy even in our\nown civilization relate to “necessities” in the original sense of\nbeing necessitated by having a body.\n",
        "Section 10. THE LOCATION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES": "\nAlthough the distinction between private and public coincides\nwith the opposition of necessity and freedom, of futility and per-\nmanence, and, finally, of shame and honor, it is by no means true\nthat only the necessary, the futile, and the shameful have their\nproper place in the private realm. The most elementary meaning\nof the two realms indicates that there are things that need to be\nhidden and others that need to be displayed publicly if they are\nto exist at all. If we look at these things, regardless of where we\nfind them in any given civilization, we shall see that each human\nactivity points to its proper location in the world. This is true for\nthe chief activities of the vita activa, labor, work, and action; but\nthere is one, admittedly extreme, example of this phenomenon,\nwhose advantage for illustration is that it played a considerable\nrole in political theory.\n\nGoodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the “good-\nfor” or the “excellent” in Greek and Roman antiquity, became\nknown in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity. Since\n\nfemmes . . . se confondaient avec leurs esclaves dans les soins habituels de la\nvie interieure, De quelque rang qu'elles fussent, le travail etait lenr apanage, com-\nme aux hommes la guerre.”\n\n81. See Pierre Brizon, Histoire du travail et des travailleurs (4th ed.; 1926), p.\n184, concerning the conditions of factory work in the seventeenth century.\n\nt 73 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthen, we know of good works as one important variety of possible\nhuman action. The well-known antagonism between early Chris-\ntianity and the res publica, so admirably summed up in Tertullian's\nformula: nec ulla magis res aliena qiiam publica (“no matter is more\nalien to us than what matters publicly ”), 82 is usually and rightly\nunderstood as a consequence of early eschatological expectations\nthat lost their immediate significance only after experience had\ntaught that even the downfall of the Roman Empire did not mean\nthe end of the world . 88 Yet the otherworldliness of Christianity\nhas still another root, perhaps even more intimately related to the\nteachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and at any rate so independent of\nthe belief in the perishability of the world that one is tempted to\nsee in it the true inner reason why Christian alienation from the\nworld could so easily survive the obvious non-fulfilment of its\neschatological hopes.\n\nThe one activity taught by Jesus in word and deed is the activity\nof goodness, and goodness obviously harbors a tendency to hide\nfrom being seen or heard. Christian hostility toward the public\nrealm, the tendency at least of early Christians to lead a life as\nfar removed from the public realm as possible, can also be under-\nstood as a self-evident consequence of devotion to good works,\nindependent of all beliefs and expectations. For it is manifest that\nthe moment a good work becomes known and public, it loses its\nspecific character of goodness, of being done for nothing but good-\nness' sake. When goodness appears openly, it is no longer good-\nness, though it may still be useful as organized charity or an act\nof solidarity. Therefore: “Take heed that ye do not your alms\nbefore men, to be seen of them.” Goodness can exist only when\nit is not perceived, not even by its author; whoever sees himself\nperforming a good work is no longer good, but at best a useful\nmember of society or a dutiful member of a church. Therefore:\n“Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.”\n\nIt may be this curious negative quality of goodness, the lack of\noutward phenomenal manifestation, that makes Jesus of Naza-\n\n82. Tertullian op. cit. 38.\n\n83. This difference of experience may partly explain the difference between\nthe great sanity of Augustine and the horrible concreteness of Tertullian's views\non politics. Both were Romans and profoundly shaped by Roman political life.\n\n[ 74 }\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm\n\n\nreth's appearance in history such a profoundly paradoxical event;\nit certainly seems to be the reason why he thought and taught that\nno man can be good: “Why callest thou me good? none is good,\nsave one, that is, God .” 84 The same conviction finds its expression\nin the talmudic story of the thirty-six righteous men, for the sake\nof whom God saves the world and who also are known to nobody,\nleast of all to themselves. We are reminded of Socrates' great in-\nsight that no man can be wise, out of which love for wisdom, or\nphilo-sophy, was born; the whole life story of Jesus seems to\ntestify how love for goodness arises out of the insight that no man\ncan be good.\n\nLove of wisdom and love of goodness, if they resolve them-\nselves into the activities of philosophizing and doing good works,\nhave in common that they come to an immediate end, cancel them-\nselves, so to speak, whenever it is assumed that man can be wise\nor be good. Attempts to bring into being that which can never\nsurvive the fleeting moment of the deed itself have never been\nlacking and have always led into absurdity. The philosophers of\nlate antiquity who demanded of themselves to be wise were absurd\nwhen they claimed to be happy when roasted alive in the famous\nPhaleric Bull. And no less absurd is the Christian demand to be\ngood and to turn the other cheek, when not taken metaphorically\nbut tried as a real way of life.\n\nBut the similarity between the activities springing from love ot\ngoodness and love of wisdom ends here. Both, it is true, stand in\na certain opposition to the public realm, but the case of goodness\nis much more extreme in this respect and therefore of greater rele-\nvance in our context. Only goodness must go into absolute hiding\nand flee all appearance if it is not to be destroyed. The philosopher,\neven if he decides with Plato to leave the “cave” of human affairs,\ndoes not have to hide from himself; on the contrary, under the sky\nof ideas he not only finds the true essences of everything that is,\n\n84. Luke 18 : 19. The same thought occurs in Matt. 6 : 1-18, where Jesus\nwarns against hypocrisy, against the open display of piety. Piety cannot “appear\nunto men” but only unto God, who “seeth in secret.” God, it is true, “shall re-\nward” man, but not, as the standard translation claims, “openly.” The German\nword Scheinheiligkeit expresses this religious phenomenon, where mere appear-\nance is already hypocrisy, quite adequately.\n\n[ 7 / ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbut also himself, in the dialogue between “me and myself” (eme\nemautS) in which Plato apparently saw the essence of thought . 85\nTo be in solitude means to be with one's self, and thinking, there-\nfore, though it may be the most solitary of all activities, is never\naltogether without a partner and without company.\n\nThe man, however, who is in love with goodness can never\nafford to lead a solitary life, and yet his living with others and for\nothers must remain essentially without testimony and lacks first\nof all the company of himself. He is not solitary, but lonely; when\nliving with others he must hide from them and cannot even trust\nhimself to witness what he is doing. The philosopher can always\nrely upon his thoughts to keep him company, whereas good deeds\ncan never keep anybody company; they must be forgotten the\nmoment they are done, because even memory will destroy their\nquality of being “good.” Moreover, thinking, because it can be\nremembered, can crystallize into thought, and thoughts, like all\nthings that owe their existence to remembrance, can be trans-\nformed into tangible objects which, like the written page or the\nprinted book, become part of the human artifice. Good works,\nbecause they must be forgotten instantly, can never become part\nof the world; they come and go, leaving no trace. They truly are\nnot of this world.\n\nIt is this worldlessness inherent in good works that makes the\nlover of goodness an essentially religious figure and that makes\ngoodness, like wisdom in antiquity, an essentially non-human,\nsuperhuman quality. And yet love of goodness, unlike love of wis-\ndom, is not restricted to the experience of the few, just as loneli-\nness, unlike solitude, is within the range of every man's experience.\nIn a sense, therefore, goodness and loneliness are of much greater\nrelevance to politics than wisdom and solitude; yet only solitude\ncan become an authentic way of life in the figure of the philosopher,\nwhereas the much more general experience of loneliness is so con-\ntradictory to the human condition of plurality that it is simply\nunbearable for any length of time and needs the company of God,\nthe only imaginable witness of good works, if it is not to annihilate\nhuman existence altogether. The otherworldiness of religious ex-\nperience, in so far as it is truly the experience of love in the sense\n\n85. One finds this idiom passim in Plato (see esp. Gorgias 482).\n\n[ 76 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public and the Private Realm,\n\n\nof an activity, and not the much more frequent one of beholding\npassively a revealed truth, manifests itself within the world itself;\nthis, like all other activities, does not leave the world, but must be\nperformed within it. But this manifestation, though it appears in\nthe space where other activities are performed and depends upon\nit, is of an actively negative nature; fleeing the world and hiding\nfrom its inhabitants, it negates the space the world offers to men,\nand most of all that public part of it where everything and every-\nbody are seen and heard by others.\n\nGoodness, therefore, as a consistent way of life, is not only\nimpossible within the confines of the public realm, it is even de-\nstructive of it. Nobody perhaps has been more sharply aware of\nthis ruinous quality of doing good than Machiavelli, who, in a\nfamous passage, dared to teach men “how not to be good .” 86\nNeedless to add, he did not say and did not mean that men must be\ntaught how to be bad; the criminal act, though for other reasons,\nmust also flee being seen and heard by others. Machiavelli's cri-\nterion for political action was glory, the same as in classical\nantiquity, and badness can no more shine in glory than goodness.\nTherefore all methods by which “one may indeed gain power,\nbut not glory” are bad . 87 Badness that comes out of hiding is\nimpudent and directly destroys the common world; goodness that\ncomes out of hiding and assumes a public role is no longer good,\nbut corrupt in its own terms and will carry its own corruption\nwherever it goes. Thus, for Machiavelli, the reason for the\nChurch's becoming a corrupting influence in Italian politics was\nher participation in secular affairs as such and not the individual\ncorruptness of bishops and prelates. To him, the alternative posed\nby the problem of religious rule over the secular realm was in-\nescapably this : either the public realm corrupted the religious body\nand thereby became itself corrupt, or the religious body re-\nmained uncorrupt and destroyed the public realm altogether. A\nreformed Church therefore was even more dangerous in Machia-\nvelli's eyes, and he looked with great respect but greater apprehen-\nsion upon the religious revival of his time, the “new orders”\nwhich, by “saving religion from being destroyed by the licentious-\n\n86.

By raising this question, I do not intend to\nattempt an exhaustive analysis of the activities of the vita activa,\nwhose articulations have been curiously neglected by a tradition\nwhich considered it chiefly from the standpoint of the vita contem-\nplativa, but to try to determine with some measure of assurance\ntheir political significance.\n\n88.

Against this scarcity of historical\nevidence, however, stands one very articulate and obstinate testi-\nmony, namely, the simple fact that every European language, an-\ncient and modern, contains two etymologically unrelated words\nfor what we have to come to think of as the same activity, and re-\ntains them in the face of their persistent synonymous usage . 5\n\nThus, Locke's distinction between working hands and a laboring\nbody is somewhat reminiscent of the ancient Greek distinction\nbetween the cheirotechn.es , the craftsman, to whom the German\nHandwerker corresponds, and those who, like “slaves and tame\nanimals with their bodies minister to the necessities of life ,” 3 4 or in\nthe Greek idiom, to somati ergazesthai, work with their bodies (yet\neven here, labor and work are already treated as identical, since\nthe word used is not ponein [labor] but ergazesthai [work]).

Thus, the Greek language distinguishes between ponein and ergazesthai,\nthe Latin between laborare and facere or fabricari, which have the same etymo-\nlogical root, the French between travailler and ouvrer, the German between\narbeiten and tverken. In all these cases, only the equivalents for “labor” have an\nunequivocal connotation of pain and trouble. The German Arbeit applied origi-\nnally only to farm labor executed by serfs and not to the work of the craftsman,\nwhich was called Werk. The French travailler replaced the older labourer and is\nderived from tripalium, a kind of torture. See Grimm, Worterbuch,pp. 1854 ff.,\nand Lucien Febre, “Travail; evolution d'un mot et d'une idee,” Journal de psy-\nchologic normale et pathologique, Vol. XLI, No. 1 (1948).\n\n4. Aristotle Politics |l254b25.\n\n\n[ 80 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nactual modern development so closely that the verb form of the\nword “work” has become rather obsolete . 6\n\nThe reason why this distinction should have been overlooked in\nancient times and its significance remained unexplored seems ob-\nvious enough. Contempt for laboring, originally arising out of a\npassionate striving for freedom from necessity and a no less pas-\nsionate impatience with every effort that left no trace, no monu-\nment, no great work worthy of remembrance, spread with the\nincreasing demands of polls life upon the time of the citizens and\nits insistence on their abstention ( skhole ) from all but political ac-\ntivities, until it covered everything that demanded an effort. Ear-\nlier political custom, prior to the full development of the city-state,\nmerely distinguished between slaves, vanquished enemies ( dmoes\nor douloi ), who were carried off to the victor's household with\nother loot where as household inmates ( oiketai or familiares ) they\nslaved for their own and their master's life, and the demiourgoi, the\nworkmen of the people at large, who moved freely outside the\nprivate realm and within the public . 6 A later time even changed the\nname for these artisans, whom Solon had still described as sons of\nAthena and Hephaestus, and called them banausoi, that is, men\nwhose chief interest is their craft and not the market place. It is\nonly from the late fifth century onward that the polls began to\nclassify occupations according to the amount of effort required, so\nthat Aristotle called those occupations the meanest “in which the\n\n\n[ 81 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbody is most deteriorated.” Although he refused to admit banausoi\nto citizenship, he would have accepted shepherds and painters (but\nneither peasants nor sculptors) . 7\n\nWe shall see later that, quite apart from their contempt for labor,\nthe Greeks had reasons of their own to mistrust the craftsman, or\nrather, the homo faber mentality. This mistrust, however, is true\nonly of certain periods, whereas all ancient estimates of human\nactivities, including those which, like Hesiod, supposedly praise\n\n7. Politics 1258b35 ff. For Aristotle's discussion about admission of banausoi\nto citizenship see Politics iii. 5. His theory corresponds closely to reality: it is\nestimated that up to 80 per cent of free labor, work, and commerce consisted of\nnon-citizens, either “strangers” ( katoikountes and metoikoi) or emancipated\nslaves who advanced into these classes (see Fritz Heichelheim, Wirtschafts-\ngeschichte des Altertums [1938], 1, 398 ff.). Jacob Burckhardt, who in his\nGriechische Kulturgeschichte (Vol. II, secs. 6 and 8) relates Greek current opin-\nion of who does and who does not belong to the class of banausoi, also notices\nthat we do not know of any treatise about sculpture. In view of the many essays\non music and poetry, this probably is no more an accident of tradition than the\nfact that we know so many stories about the great feeling of superiority and\neven arrogance among the famous painters which are not matched by anecdotes\nabout sculptors. This estimate of painters and sculptors survived many cen-\nturies. It is still found in the Renaissance, where sculpturing is counted among the\nservile arts whereas painting takes up a middle position between liberal and\nservile arts (see Otto Neurath, “Beitrage zur Geschichte der Opera Servilia,”\nArchiv filr Sozial'wissenschaftund Sozialpolitik, Vol. XLI, No. 2 [1915]).\n\nThat Greek public opinion in the city-states judged occupations according to\nthe effort required and the time consumed is supported by a remark of Aristotle\nabout the life of shepherds: “There are great differences in human ways of life.\nThe laziest are shepherds; for they get their food without labor [poms] from\ntame animals and have leisure [ skholazousin ]” ( Politics 1256a30 ff.). It is interest-\ning that Aristotle, probably following current opinion, here mentions laziness\n(aergia) together with, and somehow as a condition for, skhole, abstention from\ncertain activities which is the condition for a political life. Generally, the mod-\nem reader must be aware that aergia and skhole are not the same. Laziness had\nthe same connotations it has for us, and a life of skhole was not considered to be\na lazy life. The equation, however, of skhole and idleness is characteristic of a\ndevelopment within the polis. I hus Xenophon reports that Socrates was accused\nof having quoted Hesiod's line: “Work is no disgrace, but laziness [aergia] is a\ndisgrace.” The accusation meant that Socrates had instilled in his pupils a slavish\nspirit ( Memorabilia i. 2. 56). Historically, it is important to keep in mind the\ndistinction between the contempt of the Greek city-states for all non-political\noccupations which arose out of the enormous demands upon the time and energy\nof the citizens, and the earlier, more original, and more general contempt for\n\n[ 82 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nlabor , 8 rest on the conviction that the labor of our body which is\nnecessitated by its needs is slavish. Hence, occupations which did\nnot consist in laboring, yet were undertaken not for their own sake\nbut in order to provide the necessities of life, were assimilated to\nthe status of labor, and this explains changes and variations in their\nestimation and classification at different periods and in different\nplaces. The opinion that labor and work were despised in antiquity\nbecause only slaves were engaged in them is a prejudice of modern\nhistorians. The ancients reasoned the other way around and felt it\nnecessary to possess slaves because of the slavish nature of all oc-\ncupations that served the needs for the maintenance of life . 9 It was\nprecisely on these grounds that the institution of slavery was de-\nfended and justified. To labor meant to be enslaved by necessity,\n\nactivities which serve only to sustain life — ad vitae sustentationem as the opera\nservilia are still defined in the eighteenth century. In the world of Homer, Paris\nand Odysseus help in the building of their houses, Nausicaa herself washes the\nlinen of her brothers, etc. All this belongs to the self-sufficiency of the Homeric\nhero, to his independence and the autonomic supremacy of his person. No work\nis sordid if it means greater independence; the selfsame activity might well be a\nsign of slavishness if not personal independence but sheer survival is at stake, if\nit is not an expression of sovereignty but of subjection to necessity. The differ-\nent estimate of craftsmanship in Homer is of course well known. But its actual\nmeaning is beautifully presented in a recent essay by Richard Harder, Eigenart\nder Griechen (1949).\n\n8. Labor and work ( 'perns and ergon ) are distinguished in Hesiod; only work\nis due to Eris, the goddess of good strife ( Works and Days 20-26) , but labor, like\nall other evils, came out of Pandora's box (90 ff.) and is a punishment of Zeus\nbecause Prometheus “the crafty deceived him.” Since then, “the gods have\nhidden life from men” (42 ff.) and their curse hits “the bread-eating men” (82).\nHesiod, moreover, assumes as a matter of course that the actual farm labor is\ndone by slaves and tame animals. He praises everyday life — which for a Greek\nis already extraordinary enough — but his ideal is a gentleman-farmer, rather than\na laborer, who stays at home, keeps away from adventures of the sea as well as\npublic business on the agora (29 ff.), and tninds his own business.\n\n9. Aristotle begins his famous discussion of slavery ( Politics 12J3b25) with\nthe statement that “without the necessaries life as well as good life is impos-\nsible.” To be a master of slaves is the human way to master necessity and there-\nfore not para physin, against nature; life itself demands it. Peasants, therefore,\nwho provided the necessities of life, are classed by Plato as well as Aristotle\nwith the slaves (see Robert Schlaifer, “Greek Theories of Slavery from Homer\nto Aristotle,” Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. XLVII [1936]).\n\n[ 83 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nand this enslavement was inherent in the conditions of human life.\nBecause men were dominated by the necessities of life, they could\nwin their freedom only through the domination of those whom\nthey subjected to necessity by force. The slave's degradation was\na blow of fate and a fate worse than death, because it carried with\nit a metamorphosis of man into something akin to a tame animal . 10\nA change in a slave's status, therefore, such as manumission by his\nmaster or a change in general political circumstance that elevated\ncertain occupations to public relevance, automatically entailed a\nchange in the slave's “nature .” 11\n\nThe institution of slavery in antiquity, though not in later times,\nwas not a device for cheap labor or an instrument of exploitation\nfor profit but rather the attempt to exclude labor from the condi-\ntions of man's life. What men share with all other forms of animal\nlife was not considered to be human. (This, incidentally, was also\nthe reason for the much misunderstood Greek theory of the non-\nhuman nature of the slave. Aristotle, who argued this theory so\nexplicitly, and then, on his deathbed, freed his slaves, may not have\nbeen so inconsistent as moderns are inclined to think. He denied\nnot the slave's capacity to be human, but only the use of the word\n“men” for members of the species man-kind as long as they are\ntotally subject to necessity .) 12 And it is true that the use of the\nword “animal” in the concept of animal laborans , as distinguished\nfrom the very questionable use of the same word in the term animal\nrationale , is fully justified. The animal laborans is indeed only one,\nat best the highest, of the animal species which populate the earth.\n\n\n[ 84 ]\n\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nIt is not surprising that the distinction between labor and work\nwas ignored in classical antiquity. The differentiation between the\nprivate household and the public political realm, between the\nhousehold inmate who was a slave and the household head who\nwas a citizen, between activities which should be hidden in pri-\nvacy and those which were worth being seen, heard, and remem-\nbered, overshadowed and predetermined all other distinctions until\nonly one criterion was left; is the greater amount of time and effort\nspent in private or in public? is the occupation motivated by cura\nprivati negotii or cura rei publicae, care for private or for public\nbusiness ? 18 With the rise of political theory, the philosophers over-\nruled even these distinctions, which had at least distinguished be-\ntween activities, by opposing contemplation to all kinds of activity\nalike. With them, even political activity was leveled to the rank of\nnecessity, which henceforth became the common denominator of\nall articulations within the vita activa. Nor can we reasonably ex-\npect any help from Christian political thought, which accepted the\nphilosophers' distinction, refined it, and, religion being for the\nmany and philosophy only for the few, gave it general validity,\nbinding for all men.\n\nIt is surprising at first glance, however, that the modern age —\nwith its reversal of all traditions, the traditional rank of action and\ncontemplation no less than the traditional hierarchy within the\nvita activa itself, with its glorification of labor as the source of all\nvalues and its elevation of the animal laborans to the position tradi-\ntionally held by the animal rationale — should not have brought forth\na single theory in which animal laborans and homo faber, “the\nlabour of our body and the work of our hands,” are clearly distin-\nguished. Instead, we find first the distinction between productive\nand unproductive labor, then somewhat later the differentiation be-\ntween skilled and unskilled work, and, finally, outranking both\nbecause seemingly of more elementary significance, the division of\nall activities into manual and intellectual labor. Of the three, how-\never, only the distinction between productive and unproductive\nlabor goes to the heart of the matter, and it is no accident that the\ntwo greatest theorists in the field, Adam Smith and Karl Marx,\nbased the whole structure of their argument upon it. The very\n\n13. Cicero De re publica v. 2.\n\n\n[ 85 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nreason for the elevation of labor in the modern age was its “pro-\nductivity,” and the seemingly blasphemous notion of Marx that\nlabor (and not God) created man or that labor (and not reason)\ndistinguished man from the other animals was only the most\nradical and consistent formulation of something upon which the\nwhole modem age was agreed . 14\n\nMoreover, both Smith and Marx were in agreement with mod-\nern public opinion when they despised unproductive labor as parasit-\nical, actually a kind of perversion of labor, as though nothing were\nworthy of this name which did not enrich the world. Marx cer-\ntainly shared Smith's contempt for the “menial servants” who like\n“idle guests . . . leave nothing behind them in return for their con-\nsumption .” 16 Yet it was precisely these menial servants, these\nhousehold inmates, oiketai or familiares , laboring for sheer sub-\nsistence and needed for effortless consumption rather than for pro-\n\n14. “The creation of man through human labor” was one of the most per-\nsistent ideas of Marx since his youth. It can be found in many variations in the\nJugendschriften (where in the “Kritik der Hegelschen Dialektik” he credits\nHegel with it). (See Marx-Engels Gesmntausgabe , Part I, Vol. 5 [Berlin, 1932],\npp. 156 and 167.) That Marx actually meant to replace the traditional definition\nof man as an animal rationale by defining him as an animal laborans is manifest in\nthe context. The theory is strengthened by a sentence from the Deutsche Ideologic\nwhich was later deleted: “Der erste geschichtliche Akt dieser Individuen, wo-\ndurch sie sich von den Tieren unterscheiden, ist nicht, dass sie denken, sondern,\ndass sie anfangen ihre Lebensmittel zu produzieren” (ibid., p. 568). Similar for-\nmulations occur in the “Okonomisch-philosophische Adanuskripte” (ibid., p.\n125), and in “Die heilige Familie” (ibid., p. 189). Engels used similar formula-\ntions many times, for instance in the Preface of 1884 to Ursprung der Familie\nor in the newspaper article of 1876, “Labour in the Transition from Ape to\nMan” (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works [London, 1950], Vol. II).\n\nIt seems that Hume, and not Marx, was the first to insist that labor dis-\ntinguishes man from animal (Adriano Tilgher, Homo faber [1929]; English ed.:\nWork: What It Has Meant to Men through the Ages [1930]). As labor does not\nplay any significant role in Hume's philosophy, this is of historical interest only;\nto him, this characteristic did not make human life more productive, but only\nharsher and more painful than animal life. It is, however, interesting in this\ncontext to note with what care Hume repeatedly insisted that neither thinking\nnor reasoning distinguishes man from animal and that the behavior of beasts\ndemonstrates that they are capable of both.\n\n15. Wealth oj Nations (Everyman's ed.), II, 302.\n\n[ 86 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nduction, whom all ages prior to the modern had in mind when they\nidentified the laboring condition with slavery. What they left\nbehind them in return for their consumption was nothing more or\nless than their masters' freedom or, in modern language, their\nmasters' potential productivity.\n\nIn other words, the distinction between productive and unpro-\nductive labor contains, albeit in a prejudicial manner, the more\nfundamental distinction between work and labor . 16 It is indeed the\nmark of all laboring that it leaves nothing behind, that the result of\nits effort is almost as quickly consumed as the effort is spent. And\nyet this effort, despite its futility, is born of a great urgency and\nmotivated by a more powerful drive than anything else, because\nlife itself depends upon it. The modern age in general and Karl\nMarx in particular, overwhelmed, as it were, by the unprece-\ndented actual productivity of Western mankind, had an almost ir-\nresistible tendency to look upon all labor as work and to speak of\nthe annual laborans in terms much more fitting for homo faber,\nhoping all the time that only one more step was needed to eliminate\nlabor and necessity altogether . 17\n\nNo doubt the actual historical development that brought labor\nout of hiding and into the public realm, where it could be organized\n\n\n16. The distinction between productive and unproductive labor is due to the\nphysiocrats, who distinguished between producing, property-owning, and\nsterile classes. Since they held that the original source of all productivity lies in\nthe natural forces of the earth, their standard for productivity was related to the\ncreation of new objects and not to the needs and wants of men. Thus, the\nMarquis de Mirabeau, father of the famous orator, calls sterile “la classe\nd'ouvriers dont les travaux, quoique necessaires aux besoins des hommes et\nutiles a la societe, ne sont pas neanmoins productifs” and illustrates his distinc-\ntion between sterile and productive work by comparing it to the difference be-\ntween cutting a stone and producing it (see Jean Dautry, “La notion de travail\nchez Saint-Simon et Fourier,” Journal de psychologic normale et pathologique, Vol.\nLII, No. 1 [January-March, 1955]).\n\n17. This hope accompanied Marx from beginning to end. We find it already\nin the Deutsche Ideologic: “Es handelt sich nicht darum die Arbeit zu befreien,\nsondern sie aufzuheben” ( Gesamtausgabe , Part I, Vol. 3, p. 185) and many dec-\nades later in the third volume of Das Kapital, ch. 48: “Das Reich der Freiheit\nbeginnt in der Tat erst da, wo das Arbeiten . . . aufhort” (Marx-E ngels Gesamtaus-\ngabe, Part II [Zurich, 1933], p. 873).\n\n[ 87 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nand “divided ,” 18 constituted a powerful argument in the develop-\nment of these theories. Yet an even more significant fact in this\nrespect, already sensed by the classical economists and clearly dis-\ncovered and articulated by Karl Marx, is that the laboring activity\nitself, regardless of historical circumstances and independent of its\nlocation in the private or the public realm, possesses indeed a “pro-\nductivity” of its own, no matter how futile and non-durable its\nproducts may be. This productivity does not lie in any of labor's\nproducts but in the human “power,” whose strength is not ex-\nhausted when it has produced the means of its own subsistence and\nsurvival but is capable of producing a “surplus,” that is, more than\nis necessary for its own “reproduction.” It is because not labor it-\nself but the surplus of human “labor power\" ( Arbeitskrah ) explains\nlabor's productivity that Marx's introduction of this term, as\nEngels rightly remarked, constituted the most original and revolu-\ntionary element of his whole system . 19 Unlike the productivity of\nwork, which adds new objects to the human artifice, the productiv-\nity of labor power produces objects only incidentally and is pri-\nmarily concerned with the means of its own reproduction; since its\npower is not exhausted when its own reproduction has been se-\ncured, it can be used for the reproduction of more than one life\nprocess, but it never “produces” anything but life . 20 Through\nviolent oppression in a slave society or exploitation in the capi-\ntalist society of Marx's own time, it can be channeled in such a\nway that the labor of some suffices for the life of all.\n\nFrom this purely social viewpoint, which is the viewpoint of the\nwhole modern age but which received its most coherent and great-\n\n18. In his Introduction to the second book of the Wealth of Nations (Every-\nman's ed., I, 241 ff.), Adam Smith emphasizes that productivity is due to the\ndivision of labor rather than to labor itself.\n\n19. See Engels' Introduction to Marx's “Wage, Labour and Capital” (in Marx\nand Engels, Selected Works [London, 1950], I, 384), where Marx had introduced\nthe new term with a certain emphasis.\n\n20. Marx stressed always, and especially in his youth, that the chief function\nof labor was the “production of life” and therefore saw labor together with\nprocreation (see Deutsche Ideologic, p. 19; also “Wage, Labour and Capital,”\np. 77).\n\n\n[ 88 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nest expression in Marx's work, all laboring is “productive, and\nthe earlier distinction between the performance of “menial tasks”\nthat leave no trace and the production of things durable enough to\nbe accumulated loses its validity. The social viewpoint is identical,\nas we saw before, with an interpretation that takes nothing into\naccount but the life process of mankind, and within its frame of\nreference all things become objects of consumption. Within a com-\npletely “socialized mankind,” whose sole purpose would be the\nentertaining of the life process — and this is the unfortunately quite\nunutopian ideal that guides Marx's theories 21 — the distinction be-\ntween labor and work would have completely disappeared; all\nwork would have become labor because all things would be under-\nstood, not in their worldly, objective quality, but as results of\nliving labor power and functions of the life process . 22\n\nIt is interesting to note that the distinctions between skilled and\nunskilled and between intellectual and manual work play no role in\neither classical political economy or in Marx s work. Compared\n\n21. The terms vergesellschafteter Mensch or gesellschaftliche Mensckheit were\nfrequently used by Marx to indicate the goal of socialism (see, for instance, the\nthird volume of Das Kafital, p. 873, and the tenth of the “Theses on Feuerbach”:\n“The standpoint of the old materialism is ‘civil' society; the standpoint of the\nnew is human society, or socialized humanity” [Selected Works, II, 367]). It\nconsisted in the elimination of the gap between the individual and social exist-\nence of man, so that man “in his most individual being would be at the same time\na social being [a Gemeinviesen ] ” ( Jugendschriften , p. 113). Marx frequently calls\nthis social nature of man his Gattungs'wesen , his being a member of the species,\nand the famous Marxian “self-alienation” is first of all man s alienation from\nbeing a Gattungs'wesen (ibid., p. 89: “Eine unmittelbare Konsequenz davon, dass\nder Mensch dem Produkt seiner Arbeit, seiner Lebenstatigkeit, seinem Gattungs-\nwesen entfremdet ist, ist die Entfremdung des Menschen von dem Menschen ) .\nThe ideal society is a state of affairs where all human activities derive as natu-\nrally from human “nature” as the secretion of wax by bees for making the\nhoneycomb; to live and to labor for life will have become one and the same,\nand life will no longer “begin for [the laborer] where [the activity of laboring]\nceases” (“Wage, Labour and Capital,” p. 77).\n\n22. Marx's original charge against capitalist society was not merely its trans-\nformation of all objects into commodities, but that “the laborer behaves toward\nthe product of his labor as to an alien object” (“dass der Arbeiter zum Produkt\nseiner Arbeit als einem fremden Gegenstand sich verhalt [Jugendschriften, p.\n83]) — in other words, that the things of the world, once they have been pro-\nduced by men, are to an extent independent of, “alien” to, human life.\n\n[ 89 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwith the productivity of labor, they are indeed of secondary im-\nportance. Every activity requires a certain amount of skill, the\nactivity of cleaning and cooking no less than the writing of a book\nor the building of a house. The distinction does not apply to dif-\nferent activities but notes only certain stages and qualities within\neach of them. It could acquire a certain importance through the\nmodern division of labor, where tasks formerly assigned to the\nyoung and inexperienced were frozen into lifelong occupations.\nBut this consequence of the division of labor, where one activity is\ndivided into so many minute parts that each specialized performer\nneeds but a minimum of skill, tends to abolish skilled labor alto-\ngether, as Marx rightly predicted. Its result is that what is bought\nand sold in the labor market is not individual skill but “labor\npower,” of which each living human being should possess approxi-\nmately the same amount. Moreover, since unskilled work is a con-\ntradiction in terms, the distinction itself is valid only for the labor-\ning activity, and the attempt to use it as a major frame of reference\nalready indicates that the distinction between labor and work has\nbeen abandoned in favor of labor.\n\nQuite different is the case of the more popular category of man-\nual and intellectual work. Here, the underlying tie between the la-\nborer of the hand and the laborer of the head is again the laboring\nprocess, in one case performed by the head, in the other by some\nother part of the body. Thinking, however, which is presumably\nthe activity of the head, though it is in some way like laboring —\nalso a process which probably comes to an end only with life it-\nself — is even less “productive” than labor; if labor leaves no per-\nmanent trace, thinking leaves nothing tangible at all. By itself,\nthinking never materializes into any objects. Whenever the intel-\nlectual worker wishes to manifest his thoughts, he must use his\nhands and acquire manual skills just like any other worker. In\nother words, thinking and working are two different activities\nwhich never quite coincide; the thinker who wants the world to\nknow the “content” of his thoughts must first of all stop thinking\nand remember his thoughts. Remembrance in this, as in all other\ncases, prepares the intangible and the futile for their eventual ma-\nterialization; it is the beginning of the work process, and like the\ncraftsman's consideration of the model which will guide his work,\n\n[ 90 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nits most immaterial stage. The work itself then always requires\nsome material upon which it will be performed and which through\nfabrication, the activity of homo faber, will be transformed into a\nworldly object. The specific work quality of intellectual work is\nno less due to the “work of our hands” than any other kind of\nwork.\n\nIt seems plausible and is indeed quite common to connect and\njustify the modern distinction between intellectual and manual la-\nbor with the ancient distinction between “liberal” and “servile\narts.” Yet the distinguishing mark between liberal and servile arts\nis not at all “a higher degree of intelligence,” or that the “liberal\nartist” works with his brain and the “sordid tradesman” with his\nhands. The ancient criterion is primarily political. Occupations in-\nvolving prudentia, the capacity for prudent judgment which is the\nvirtue of statesmen, and professions of public relevance (ad ho-\nminum utilitatem) M such as architecture, medicine, and agricul-\nture , 24 are liberal. All trades, the trade of a scribe no less than that\nof a carpenter, are “sordid,” unbecoming for a full-fledged citizen,\nand the worst are those we would deem most useful, such as\n“fishmongers, butchers, cooks, poulterers and fishermen .” 26 But\nnot even these are necessarily sheer laboring. There is still a third\ncategory where the toil and effort itself (the operae as distin-\nguished from the opus , the mere activity as distinguished from the\n\n23. For convenience' sake, I shall follow Cicero's discussion of liberal and\nservile occupations in De ojjiciis i. 50-54. The criteria of prudentia and utilitas\nor utilitas haminum are stated in pars. 151 and 155. (The translation of prudentia\nas “a higher degree of intelligence” by Walter Miller in the Loeb Classical Li-\nbrary edition seems to me to be misleading.)\n\n24. The classification of agriculture among the liberal arts is, of course,\nspecifically Roman. It is not due to any special “usefulness” of farming as we\nwould understand it, but much rather related to the Roman idea of patria, accord-\ning to which the ager Romanus and not only the city of Rome is the place occu-\npied by the public realm.\n\n25. It is this usefulness for sheer living which Cicero calls mediocris utilitas\n(par. 151) and eliminates from liberal arts. The translation again seems to me\nto miss the point; these are not “professions . . . from which no small benefit\nto society is derived,” but occupations which, in clear opposition to those men-\ntioned before, transcend the vulgar usefulness of consumer goods.\n\n[ 91 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwork) is paid, and in these cases “the very wage is a pledge of\nslavery .” 26\n\nThe distinction between manual and intellectual work, though\nits origin can be traced back to the Middle Ages , 27 is modern and\nhas two quite different causes, both of which, however, are equally\ncharacteristic of the general climate of the modern age. Since under\nmodern conditions every occupation had to prove its “usefulness”\nfor society at large, and since the usefulness of the intellectual oc-\ncupations had become more than doubtful because of the modern\nglorification of labor, it was only natural that intellectuals, too,\nshould desire to be counted among the working population. At the\nsame time, however, and only in seeming contradiction to this de-\nvelopment, the need and esteem of this society for certain “intel-\nlectual” performances rose to a degree unprecedented in our his-\ntory except in the centuries of the decline of the Roman Empire.\nIt may be well to remember in this context that throughout ancient\nhistory the “intellectual” services of the scribes, whether they\nserved the needs of the public or the private realm, were performed\nby slaves and rated accordingly. Only the bureaucratization of the\nRoman Empire and the concomitant social and political rise of the\nEmperors brought a re-evaluation of “intellectual” services . 28 In so\n\n26. The Romans deemed the difference between opus and operas to be so de-\ncisive that they had two different forms of contract, the locatio operis and the\nlocatio operarum, of which the latter played an insignificant role because most\nlaboring was done by slaves (see Edgar Loening, in Handworterbuch der Staats-\n'wissenschaften [1890], I, 742 ff.).\n\n27. The opera liberalia were identified with intellectual or rather spiritual\nwork in the Middle Ages (see Otto Neurath, “Beitrage zur Geschichte der Opera\nServilia,” Archivfur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, Vol. XLI [1915], No. 2).\n\n28.

Wallcm describes this process under the rule of Diocletian: “ . . . les fonc-\ntions jadis serviles se trouverent anoblies, elevees au premier rang de l'fitat.\nCette haute consideration qui de l'empereur se rdpandait sur les premiers\nserviteurs du palais, sur les plus hauts dignitaires de 1' empire, descendait a tous\nles degres des fonctions publiques . . . ; le service public devint un office public.”\n“Les charges les plus serviles, ... les noms que nous avons cites aux fonctions de\nl'esclavage, sont revetus de l'eclat qui rejaillit de la personne du prince” (His-\ntone de I'esclavage dans I'antiquite [1847], III, 126 and 131). Before this elevation\nof the services, the scribes had been classified with the watchmen of public\nbuildings or even with the men who led the prize fighters down to the arena\n\n[ 92 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nfar as the intellectual is indeed not a “worker”— who like all other\nworkers, from the humblest craftsman to the greatest artist, is\nengaged in adding one more, if possible durable, thing to the human\nartifice— he resembles perhaps nobody so much as Adam Smith s\n“menial servant,” although his function is less to keep the life\nprocess intact and provide for its regeneration than to care for the\nupkeep of the various gigantic bureaucratic machines whose proc-\nesses consume their services and devour their products as quickly\nand mercilessly as the biological life process itself . 29\n",
        "Section 12. THE THING-CHARACTER OF THE WORLD": "\nThe contempt for labor in ancient theory and its glorification in\nmodern theory both take their bearing from the subjective attitude\nor activity of the laborer, mistrusting his painful effort or praising\nhis productivity. The subjectivity of the approach may be more\nobvious in the distinction between easy and hard work, but we saw\nthat at least in the case of Marx— who, as the greatest of modern\nlabor theorists, necessarily provides a kind of touchstone in these\ndiscussions— labor's productivity is measured and gauged against\nthe requirements of the life process for its own reproduction; it\nresides in the potential surplus inherent in human labor power, not\nin the quality or character of the things it produces. Similarly,\nGreek opinion, which ranked painters higher than sculptors, cer-\ntainly did not rest upon a higher regard for paintings . 30 It seems\n\n{ibid.., p. 171). It seems noteworthy that the elevation of the “intellectuals\ncoincided with the establishment of a bureaucracy.\n\n29. “The labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like\nthat of menial servants, unproductive of any value,” says Adam Smith and ranks\namong them “the whole army and navy,” the “servants of the public, and the\nliberal professions, such as “churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters of\nall kinds.” Their work, “like the declamation of the actors, the harangue of the\norator, or the tune of the musician . . . perishes in the very instant of its pro-\nduction” (op. cit., I, 295-96). Obviously, Smith would not have had any diffi-\nculty classifying our “white-collar jobs.”\n\n30. On the contrary, it is doubtful whether any painting was ever as much\nadmired as Phidias' statue of Zeus at Olympia, whose magical power was cred-\n\n[ 93 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthat the distinction between labor and work, which our theorists\nhave so obstinately neglected and our languages so stubbornly pre-\nserved, indeed becomes merely a difference in degree if the worldly\ncharacter of the produced thing — its location, function, and length\nof stay in the world — is not taken into account. The distinction\nbetween a bread, whose “life expectancy” in the world is hardly\nmore than a day, and a table, which may easily survive generations\nof men, is certainly much more obvious and decisive than the dif-\nference between a baker and a carpenter.\n\nThe curious discrepancy between language and theory which we\nnoted at the outset therefore turns out to be a discrepancy between\nthe world-oriented, “objective” language we speak and the man-\noriented, subjective theories we use in our attempts at understand-\ning. It is language, and the fundamental human experiences under-\nlying it, rather than theory, that teaches us that the things of the\nworld, among which the vita activa spends itself, are of a very dif-\nferent nature and produced by quite different kinds of activities.\nViewed as part of the world, the products of work — and not the\nproducts of labor — guarantee the permanence and durability with-\nout which a world would not be possible at all. It is within this\nworld of durable things that we find the consumer goods through\nwhich life assures the means of its own survival. Needed by our\nbodies and produced by its laboring, but without stability of their\nown, these things for incessant consumption appear and disappear\nin an environment of things that are not consumed but used, and to\nwhich, as we use them, we become used and accustomed. As such,\nthey give rise to the familiarity of the world, its customs and habits\nof intercourse between men and things as well as between men and\nmen. What consumer goods are for the life of man, use objects are\nfor his world. From them, consumer goods derive their thing-char-\nacter; and language, which does not permit the laboring activity to\nform anything so solid and non-verbal as a noun, hints at the strong\nprobability that we would not even know what a thing is without\nhaving before us “the work of our hands.”\n\nDistinguished from both, consumer goods and use objects, there\n\nited to make one forget all trouble and sorrow; whoever had not seen it had\nlived in vain, etc.\n\n\n[ 94 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nare finally the “products” of action and speech, which together\nconstitute the fabric of human relationships and affairs. Left to\nthemselves, they lack not only the tangibility of other things, but\nare even less durable and more futile than what we produce for\nconsumption. Their reality depends entirely upon human plurality,\nupon the constant presence of others who can see and hear and\ntherefore testify to their existence. Acting and speaking are still\noutward manifestations of human life, which knows only one ac-\ntivity that, though related to the exterior world in many ways, is\nnot necessarily manifest in it and needs neither to be seen nor heard\nnor used nor consumed in order to be real: the activity of thought.\n\nViewed, however, in their worldliness, action, speech, and\nthought have much more in common than any one of them has with\nwork or labor. They themselves do not “produce,” bring forth\nanything, they are as futile as life itself. In order to become\nworldly things, that is, deeds and facts and events and patterns of\nthoughts or ideas, they must first be seen, heard, and remembered\nand then transformed, reified as it were, into things— into sayings\nof poetry, the written page or the printed book, into paintings or\nsculpture, into all sorts of records, documents, and monuments.\nThe whole factual world of human affairs depends for its reality\nand its continued existence, first, upon the presence of others who\nhave seen and heard and will remember, and, second, on the trans-\nformation of the intangible into the tangibility of things. Without\nremembrance and without the reification which remembrance\nneeds for its own fulfilment and which makes it, indeed, as the\nGreeks held, the mother of all arts, the living activities of action,\nspeech, and thought would lose their reality at the end of each\nprocess and disappear as though they never had been. The ma-\nterialization they have to undergo in order to remain in the world\nat all is paid for in that always the “dead letter” replaces some-\nthing which grew out of and for a fleeting moment indeed existed\nas the “living spirit.” They must pay this price because they them-\nselves are of an entirely unworldly nature and therefore need the\nhelp of an activity of an altogether different nature; they depend\nfor their reality and materialization upon the same workmanship\nthat builds the other things in the human artifice.\n\nThe reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on\n\n[ 95 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe fact that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the\nactivity by which they were produced, and potentially even more\npermanent than the lives of their authors. Human life, in so far as it\nis world-building, is engaged in a constant process of reification,\nand the degree of worldliness of produced things, which all to-\ngether form the human artifice, depends upon their greater or\nlesser permanence in the world itself.\n",
        "Section 13. LABOR AND LIFE": "\nThe least durable of tangible things are those needed for the life\nprocess itself. Their consumption barely survives the act of their\nproduction; in the words of Locke, all those “good things” which\nare “really useful to the life of man,” to the “necessity of sub-\nsisting,” are “generally of short duration, such as — if they are not\nconsumed by use — -will decay and perish by themselves .” 31 After\na brief stay in the world, they return into the natural process which\nyielded them either through absorption into the life process of the\nhuman animal or through decay; in their man-made shape, through\nwhich they acquired their ephemeral place in the world of man-\nmade things, they disappear more quickly than any other part of\nthe world. Considered in their worldliness, they are the least\nworldly and at the same time the most natural of all things. Al-\nthough they are man-made, they come and go, are produced and\nconsumed, in accordance with the ever-recurrent cyclical move-\nment of nature. Cyclical, too, is the movement of the living or-\nganism, the human body not excluded, as long as it can withstand\nthe process that permeates its being and makes it alive. Life is a\nprocess that everywhere uses up durability, wears it down, makes\nit disappear, until eventually dead matter, the result of small,\nsingle, cyclical, life processes, returns into the over-all gigantic\ncircle of nature herself, where no beginning and no end exist and\nwhere all natural things swing in changeless, deathless repetition.\n\nNature and the cyclical movement into which she forces all liv-\ning things know neither birth nor death as we understand them.\nThe birth and death of human beings are not simple natural oc-\n\n31. Locke, op. cit., sec. 46.\n\n\n[ 96 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\ncurrences, but are related to a world into which single individuals,\nunique, unexchangeable, and unrepeatable entities, appear and from\nwhich they depart. Birth and death presuppose a world which is\nnot in constant movement, but whose durability and relative per-\nmanence makes appearance and disappearance possible, which ex-\nisted before any one individual appeared into it and will survive\nhis eventual departure. Without a world into which men are born\nand from which they die, there would be nothing but changeless\neternal recurrence, the deathless everlastingness of the human as of\nall other animal species. A philosophy of life that does not arrive,\nas did Nietzsche, at the affirmation of “eternal recurrence” (ewige\nWiederkehr) as the highest principle of all being, simply does not\nknow what it is talking about.\n\nThe word “life,” however, has an altogether different meaning\nif it is related to the world and meant to designate the time interval\nbetween birth and death. Limited by a beginning and an end, that\nis, by the two supreme events of appearance and disappearance\nwithin the world, it follows a strictly linear movement whose very\nmotion nevertheless is driven by the motor of biological life which\nman shares with other living things and which forever retains the\ncyclical movement of nature. The chief characteristic of this spe-\ncifically human life, whose appearance and disappearance consti-\ntute worldly events, is that it is itself always full of events which\nultimately can be told as a story, establish a biography; it is of this\nlife, bios as distinguished from mere zoe, that Aristotle said that it\n“somehow is a kind of praxis .” 32 For action and speech, which, as\nwe saw before, belonged close together in the Greek understanding\nof politics, are indeed the two activities whose end result will al-\nways be a story with enough coherence to be told, no matter how\naccidental or haphazard the single events and their causation may\nappear to be.\n\nIt is only within the human world that nature's cyclical move-\nment manifests itself as growth and decay. Like birth and death,\nthey, too, are not natural occurrences, properly speaking; they\nhave no place in the unceasing, indefatigable cycle in which the\nwhole household of nature swings perpetually. Only when they\nenter the man-made world can nature's processes be characterized\n\n32. Politics 1254a7.\n\n\n[ 97 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nby growth and decay; only if we consider nature's products, this\ntree or this dog, as individual things, thereby already removing\nthem from their “natural” surroundings and putting them into our\nworld, do they begin to grow and to decay. While nature manifests\nitself in human existence through the circular movement of our\nbodily functions, she makes her presence felt in the man-made\nworld through the constant threat of overgrowing or decaying it.\nThe common characteristic of both, the biological process in man\nand the process of growth and decay in the world, is that they are\npart of the cyclical movement of nature and therefore endlessly\nrepetitive; all human activities which arise out of the necessity to\ncope with them are bound to the recurring cycles of nature and\nhave in themselves no beginning and no end, properly speaking;\nunlike working , whose end has come when the object is finished,\nready to be added to the common world of things, laboring always\nmoves in the same circle, which is prescribed by the biological\nprocess of the living organism and the end of its “toil and trouble”\ncomes only with the death of this organism . 33\n\nWhen Marx defined labor as “man's metabolism with nature,”\n\n33. In the earlier literature on labor up to the last third of the nineteenth cen-\ntury, it was not uncommon to insist on the connection between labor and the\ncyclical movement of the life process. Thus, Schulze-Delitzsch, in a lecture Die\nArbeit (Leipzig, 1863), begins with a description of the cycle of desire-effort-\nsatisfaction — “Beim letzten Bissen fiingt schon die Verdauung an.” However,\nin the huge post-Marxian literature on the labor problem, the only author who\nemphasizes and theorizes about this most elementary aspect of the laboring\nactivity is Pierre Naville, whose La vie de travail et ses problemes (1954) is one\nof the most interesting and perhaps the most original recent contribution. Dis-\ncussing the particular traits of the workday as distinguished from other measure-\nment of labor time, he says as follows: “Le trait principal est son caractere\ncyclique ou rythmique. Ce caractere est lie a la fois a l'csprit naturel et cosmolo-\ngique de la joumee . . . et au caractere des fonctions physiologiques de l'etre\nhumain, qu'il a en commun avec Ies especes animales superieures. ... II est evi-\ndent que le travail devait etre de prime abord lie a des rythmes et fonctions\nnaturels.” From this follows the cyclical character in the expenditure and re-\nproduction of labor power that determines the time unit of the workday.\nNaville' s most important insight is that the time character of human life, inas-\nmuch as it is not merely part of the life of the species, stands in stark contrast to\nthe cyclical time character of the workday. “Les limites naturelles superieures\nde la vie . . . ne sont pas dictees, comme celle de la journee, par la necessite et la\npossibility de se reproduire, mais au contraire, par l'impossibilite de se renouveler,\n\n[ 98 ]\n\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nin whose process “nature's material [is] adapted by a change of\nform to the wants of man,” so that “labour has incorporated itself\nwith its subject,” he indicated clearly that he was “speaking\nphysiologically” and that labor and consumption are but two stages\nof the ever-recurring cycle of biological life . 34 This cycle needs to\nbe sustained through consumption, and the activity which provides\nthe means of consumption is laboring . 36 Whatever labor produces\nis meant to be fed into the human life process almost immediately,\nand this consumption, regenerating the life process, produces — or\nrather, reproduces — new “labor power,” needed for the further\nsustenance of the body . 36 From the viewpoint of the exigencies of\n\nsinon a l'echelle de l'espece. Le cycle s'accomplit en une fois, et ne se renouvelle\npas” (pp. 19-24).\n\n34. Capital (Modem Library ed.), p. 201. This formula is frequent in Marx's\nwork and always repeated almost verbatim: Labor is the eternal natural necessity\nto effect the metabolism between man and nature. (See, for instance, Das Kapital,\nVol. I, Part 1, ch. 1, sec. 2, and Part 3, ch. J. The standard English translation,\nModern Library ed., pp. 50, 205, falls short of Marx's precision.) We find\nalmost the same formulation in Vol. Ill of Das Kapital , p. 872. Obviously, when\nMarx speaks as he frequently does of the “life process of society,” he is not\nthinking in metaphors.\n\n35. Marx called labor “productive consumption” ( Capital [Modem Library ed.],\np. 204) and never lost sight of its being a physiological condition.\n\n36. Marx's whole theory hinges on the early insight that the laborer first of\nall reproduces his own life by producing his means of subsistence. In his early\nwritings he thought “that men begin to distinguish themselves from animals when\nthey begin to produce their means of subsistence” ( Deutsche Ideologic, p. 10).\nThis indeed is the very content of the definition of man as animal lahorans. It is\nall the more noteworthy that in other passages Marx is not satisfied with this\ndefinition because it does not distinguish man sharply enough from animals. “A\nspider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to\nshame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes\nthe worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his struc-\nture in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-\nprocess, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at\nits commencement” ( Capital [Modern Library ed.], p. 198). Obviously, Marx\nno longer speaks of labor, but of work— with which he is not concerned; and the\nbest proof of this is that the apparently all-important element of “imagination”\nplays no role whatsoever in his labor theory. In the third volume of Das Kapital\nhe repeats that surplus labor beyond immediate needs serves the “progressive\nextension of the reproduction process” (pp. 872, 278). Despite occasional hesi-\n\n[ 99 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe life process itself, the “necessity of subsisting,” as Locke put\nit, laboring and consuming follow each other so closely that they\nalmost constitute one and the same movement, which is hardly\nended when it must be started all over again. The “necessity of\nsubsisting” rules over both labor and consumption, and labor, when\nit incorporates, “gathers,” and bodily “mixes with” the things pro-\nvided by nature , 37 does actively what the body does even more\nintimately when it consumes its nourishment. Both are devouring\nprocesses that seize and destroy matter, and the “work” done by\nlabor upon its material is only the preparation for its eventual\ndestruction.\n\nThis destructive, devouring aspect of the laboring activity, to be\nsure, is visible only from the standpoint of the world and in distinc-\ntion from work, which does not prepare matter for incorporation\nbut changes it into material in order to work upon it and use the\nfinished product. From the viewpoint of nature, it is work rather\nthan labor that is destructive, since the work process takes matter\nout of nature's hands without giving it back to her in the swift\ncourse of the natural metabolism of the living body.\n\nEqually bound up with the recurring cycles of natural move-\nments, but not quite so urgently imposed upon man by “the condi-\ntion of human life” itself , 38 is the second task of laboring — its con-\nstant, unending fight against the processes of growth and decay\nthrough which nature forever invades the human artifice, threat-\nening the durability of the world and its fitness for human use.\nThe protection and preservation of the world against natural\nprocesses are among the toils which need the monotonous perform-\nance of daily repeated chores. This laboring fight, as distinguished\nfrom the essentially peaceful fulfilment in which labor obeys the\norders of immediate bodily needs, although it may be even less\n“productive” than man's direct metabolism with nature, has a\nmuch closer connection with the world, which it defends against\n\ntations, Marx remained convinced that “Milton produced Paradise Lost for the\nsame reason a silk worm produces silk” ( Theories of Surplus Value [London,\n1951], p. 186).\n\n37. Locke, op. cit., secs. 46, 26, and 27, respectively.\n\n38. Ibid., sec. 34.\n\n\n[ 100 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nnature. In old tales and mythological stories it has often assumed\nthe grandeur of heroic fights against overwhelming odds, as in the\naccount of Hercules, whose cleaning of the Augean stables is\namong the twelve heroic “labors.” A similar connotation of heroic\ndeeds requiring great strength and courage and performed in a\nfighting spirit is manifest in the medieval use of the word: labor,\ntravail , arebeit. However, the daily fight in which the human body\nis engaged to keep the world clean and prevent its decay bears little\nresemblance to heroic deeds; the endurance it needs to repair every\nday anew the waste of yesterday is not courage, and what makes\nthe effort painful is not danger but its relentless repetition. The\nHerculean “labors” share with all great deeds that they are unique;\nbut unfortunately it is only the mythological Augean stable that\nwill remain clean once the effort is made and the task achieved.\n",
        "Section 14. LABOR AND FERTILITY": "\nThe sudden, spectacular rise of labor from the lowest, most de-\nspised position to the highest rank, as the most esteemed of all\nhuman activities, began when Locke discovered that labor is the\nsource of all property. It followed its course when Adam Smith\nasserted that labor was the source of all wealth and found its cli-\nmax in Marx's “system of labor ,” 39 where labor became the\nsource of all productivity and the expression of the very humanity\nof man. Of the three, however, only Marx was interested in labor\nas such; Locke was concerned with the institution of private prop-\nerty as the root of society and Smith wished to explain and to se-\ncure the unhampered progress of a limitless accumulation of\nwealth. But all three, though Marx with greatest force and con-\nsistency, held that labor was considered to be the supreme world-\nbuilding capacity of man, and since labor actually is the most nat-\nural and least worldly of man's activities, each of them, and again\nnone more than Marx, found himself in the grip of certain genuine\ncontradictions. It seems to lie in the very nature of this matter that\n\n39. The expression is Karl Dunkmann's ( Soziologie der Arbeit [1933], p. 71),\nwho rightly remarks that the title of Marx's great work is a misnomer and\nshould better have been called System der Arbeit.\n\n[ 101 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe most obvious solution of these contradictions, or rather the\nmost obvious reason why these great authors should have remained\nunaware of them is their equation of work with labor, so that labor\nis endowed by them with certain faculties which only work pos-\nsesses. This equation always leads into patent absurdities, though\nthey usually are not so neatly manifest as in the following sentence\nof Veblen: “The lasting evidence of productive labor is its mate-\nrial product — commonly some article of consumption ,” 40 where\nthe “lasting evidence” with which he begins, because he needs it\nfor the alleged productivity of labor, is immediately destroyed by\nthe “consumption” of the product with which he ends, forced, as it\nwere, by the factual evidence of the phenomenon itself.\n\nThus Locke, in order to save labor from its manifest disgrace of\nproducing only “things of short duration,” had to introduce money\n—a “lasting thing which men may keep without spoiling” — a kind\nof deus ex machina without which the laboring body, in its obedience\nto the life process, could never have become the origin of anything\nso permanent and lasting as property, because there are no “du-\nrable things” to be kept to survive the activity of the laboring proc-\ness. And even Marx, who actually defined man as an animal\nlaborans, had to admit that productivity of labor, properly speak-\ning, begins only with reification (Vergegemtdndlichung) , with “the\nerection of an objective world of things” ( Erzeugung einer ge-\ngenstand lichen Welt): n But the effort of labor never frees the labor-\n\n40. The curious formulation occurs in Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the\nLeisure Class (1917), p. 44.\n\n41. The term vergegenstdndlichen occurs not very frequently in Marx, but al-\nways in a crucial context. Cf. Jugendschriften, p. 88: “Das praktische Erzeugen\neiner gegenstandlichen Welt, die Bearbeitung der unorganischen Natur ist die\nBewahrung des Menschen als eines bewussten Gattungswesens. . . . [Das Tier]\nproduziert unter der Herrschaft des unmittelbaren Bediirfnisses, wahrend der\nMensch selbst frei vom physischen Bedurfnis produziert und erst wahrhaft\nproduziert in der Freiheit von demselben.” Here, as in the passage from Capital\nquoted in note 36, Marx obviously introduces an altogether different concept\nof labor, that is, speaks about work and fabrication. The same reification is\nmentioned in Das Kapital (Vol. I, Part 3, ch. 5), though somewhat equivocally:\n“[Die Arbeit] ist vergegenstandlicht und der Gegenstand ist verarbeitet.” The\nplay on words with the term Gegenstand obscures what actually happens in the\nprocess: through reification, a new thing has been produced, but the “object”\nthat this process transformed into a thing is, from the viewpoint of the process,\n\n[ 102 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\ning animal from repeating it all over again and remains therefore an\n“eternal necessity imposed by nature .” 42 When Marx insists that\nthe labor “process comes to its end in the product ,” 43 he forgets his\nown definition of this process as the “metabolism between man and\nnature” into which the product is immediately “incorporated,”\nconsumed, and annihilated by the body's life process.\n\nSince neither Locke nor Smith is concerned with labor as such,\nthey can afford to admit certain distinctions which actually would\namount to a distinction in principle between labor and work, if it\nwere not for an interpretation that treats of the genuine traits of\nlaboring as merely irrelevant. Thus, Smith calls “unproductive\nlabor” all activities connected with consumption, as though this\nwere a negligible and accidental trait of something whose true\nnature was to be productive. The very contempt with which he\ndescribes how “menial tasks and services generally perish in the\ninstant of their performance and seldom leave any trace or value\nbehind them ” 44 is much more closely related to premodern opinion\non this matter than to its modern glorification. Smith and Locke\nwere still quite aware of the fact that not every kind of labor “puts\nthe difference of value on everything ” 45 and that there exists a kind\nof activity which adds nothing “to the value of the materials which\n[it] works upon .” 46 To be sure, labor, too, joins to nature something\nof man's own, but the proportion between what nature gives —\nthe “good things” — and what man adds is the very opposite in the\nproducts of labor and the products of work. The “good things” for\nconsumption never lose their naturalness altogether, and the grain\nnever quite disappears in the bread as the tree has disappeared in\nthe table. Thus, Locke, although he paid little attention to his own\ndistinction between “the labour of our body and the work of our\n\nonly material and not a thing. (The Engish translation, Modern Library ed., p.\n201, misses the meaning of the German text and therefore escapes the equivo-\ncality.)\n\n42. This is a recurrent formulation in Marx's works. See, for instance, Das\nKapital, Vol. I (Modern Library ed., p. SO) and Vol. Ill, pp. 873-74.\n\n43. “Des Prozess erlischt im Produkt” ( Das Kapital, Vol. I, Part 3, ch. S) .\n\n44.

Adam Smith, op. cit., I, 294.\n\n[ 103 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nhands,” had to acknowledge the distinction between things “of\nshort duration” and those “lasting” long enough “that men might\nkeep them without spoiling .” 47 The difficulty for Smith and Locke\nwas the same; their “products” had to stay long enough in the\nworld of tangible things to become “valuable,” whereby it is im-\nmaterial whether value is defined by Locke as something which\ncan be kept and becomes property or by Smith as something which\nlasts long enough to be exchangeable for something else.\n\nThese certainly are minor points if compared with the funda-\nmental contradiction which runs like a red thread through the\nwhole of Marx's thought, and is present no less in the third volume\nof Capital than in the writings of the young Marx. Marx's attitude\ntoward labor, and that is toward the very center of his thought,\nhas never ceased to be equivocal . 48 While it was an “eternal neces-\nsity imposed by nature” and the most human and productive of\nman's activities, the revolution, according to Marx, has not the\ntask of emancipating the laboring classes but of emancipating man\nfrom labor; only when labor is abolished can the “realm of free-\ndom” supplant the “realm of necessity.” For “the realm of freedom\nbegins only where labor determined through want and external\nutility ceases,” where “the rule of immediate physical needs”\nends . 49 Such fundamental and flagrant contradictions rarely occur\n\n47. 0-p. cit., secs. 46 and 47.\n\n48. Jules Vuillemin's Litre et le travail (1949) is a good example of what\nhappens if one tries to resolve the central contradictions and equivocalities of\nMarx's thoughts. This is possible only if one abandons the phenomenal evidence\naltogether and begins to treat Marx's concepts as though they constituted in\nthemselves a complicated jigsaw puzzle of abstractions. Thus, labor “springs\napparently from necessity” but “actually realizes the work of liberty and affirms\nour power”; in labor “necessity expresses [for man] a hidden freedom” (pp. IS,\n16). Against these attempts at a sophisticated vulgarization, one may remember\nMarx's own sovereign attitude toward his work as Kautsky reports it in the\nfollowing anecdote: Kautsky asked Marx in 1881 if he did not contemplate an\nedition of his complete works, whereupon Marx replied: “These works must\nfirst be written” (Kautsky, Aus der Friihzeit des Marxmismus [1935], p. 53).\n\n49. Das Kapital, III, 873. In the Deutsche Ideologic Marx states that “die kom-\nmunistische Revolution ... die Arbeit beseitigt” (p. 59), after having stated\nsome pages earlier (p. 10) that only through labor does man distinguish himself\nfrom animals.\n\n\n[ 104 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nin second-rate writers; in the work of the great authors they lead\ninto the very center of their work. In the case of Marx, whose\nloyalty and integrity in describing phenomena as they presented\nthemselves to his view cannot be doubted, the important discrep-\nancies in his work, noted by all Marx scholars, can neither be\nblamed upon the difference “between the scientific point of view of\nthe historian and the moral point of view of the prophet ” 60 nor on a\ndialectical movement which needs the negative, or evil, to produce\nthe positive, or good. The fact remains that in all stages of his\nwork he defines man as an animal laborans and then leads him into a\nsociety in which this greatest and most human power is no longer\nnecessary. We are left with the rather distressing alternative be-\ntween productive slavery and unproductive freedom.\n\nThus, the question arises why Locke and all his successors, their\nown insights notwithstanding, clung so obstinately to labor as the\norigin of property, of wealth, of all values and, finally, of the very\nhumanity of man. Or, to put it another way, what were the experi-\nences inherent in the laboring activity that proved of such great\nimportance to the modern age?\n\nHistorically, political theorists from the seventeenth century\nonward were confronted with a hitherto unheard-of process of\ngrowing wealth, growing property, growing acquisition. In the at-\ntempt to account for this steady growth, their attention was natu-\nrally drawn to the phenomenon of a progressing process itself, so\nthat, for reasons we shall have to discuss later , 61 the concept of\nprocess became the very key term of the new age as well as the\nsciences, historical and natural, developed by it. From its begin-\nning, this process, because of its apparent endlessness, was under-\nstood as a natural process and more specifically in the image of the\nlife process itself. The crudest superstition of the modern age —\nthat “money begets money” — as well as its sharpest political in-\nsight — that power generates power — owes its plausibility to the\nunderlying metaphor of the natural fertility of life. Of all human\nactivities, only labor, and neither action nor work, is unending,\n\n50. The formulation is Edmund Wilson's in To the Finland Station (Anchor ed.,\n19S3), but this criticism is familiar in Marxian literature.\n\n51. See ch. vi, § 42, below.\n\n\n[ 105 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nprogressing automarically in accordance with life itself and outside\nthe range of wilful decisions or humanly meaningful purposes.\n\nPerhaps nothing indicates more clearly the level of Marx's\nthought and the faithfulness of his descriptions to phenomenal real-\nity than that he based his whole theory on the understanding of\nlaboring and begetting as two modes of the same fertile life proc-\ness. Labor was to him the “reproduction of one's own life” which\nassured the survival of the individual, and begetting was the pro-\nduction “of foreign life” which assured the survival of the spe-\ncies . 62 This insight is chronologically the never-forgotten origin of\nhis theory, which he then elaborated by substituting for “abstract\nlabor” the labor power of a living organism and by understanding\nlabor's surplus as that amount of labor power still extant after the\nmeans for the laborer's own reproduction have been produced.\nWith it, he sounded a depth of experience reached by none of his\npredecessors— to whom he otherwise owed almost all his decisive\ninspirations — and none of his successors. He squared his theory,\nthe theory of the modern age, with the oldest and most persistent\ninsights into the nature of labor, which, according to the Hebrew\nas well as the classical tradition, was as intimately bound up with\nlife as giving birth. By the same token, the true meaning of labor's\nnewly discovered productivity becomes manifest only in Marx's\nwork, where it rests on the equation of productivity with fertility,\nso that the famous development of mankind's “productive forces”\ninto a society of an abundance of “good things” actually obeys no\nother law and is subject to no other necessity than the aboriginal\ncommand, “Be ye fruitful and multiply,” in which it is as though\nthe voice of nature herself speaks to us.\n\nThe fertility of the human metabolism with nature, growing out\nof the natural redundancy of labor power, still partakes of the\nsuperabundance we see everywhere in nature's household. The\n“blessing or the joy” of labor is the human way to experience the\nsheer bliss of being alive which we share with all living creatures,\nand it is even the only way men, too, can remain and swing con-\ntentedly in nature's prescribed cycle, toiling and resting, laboring\nand consuming, with the same happy and purposeless regularity\nwith which day and night and life and death follow each other.\n\n52. Deutsche Ideologic, p. 17.\n\n[ 106 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nThe reward of toil and trouble lies in nature's fertility, in the quiet\nconfidence that he who in “toil and trouble” has done his part, re-\nmains a part of nature in the future of his children and his children's\nchildren. The Old Testament, which, unlike classical antiquity,\nheld life to be sacred and therefore neither death nor labor to be an\nevil (and least of all an argument against life ), 63 shows in the\nstories of the patriarchs how unconcerned about death their lives\nwere, how they needed neither an individual, earthly immortality\nnor an assurance of the eternity of their souls, how death came to\nthem in the familiar shape of night and quiet and eternal rest “in a\ngood old age and full of years.”\n\nThe blessing of life as a whole, inherent in labor, can never be\nfound in work and should not be mistaken for the inevitably brief\nspell of relief and joy which follows accomplishment and attends\nachievement. The blessing of labor is that effort and gratification\nfollow each other as closely as producing and consuming the means\n\n53. Nowhere in the Old Testament is death “the wage of sin.” Nor did the\ncurse by which man was expelled from paradise punish him with labor and\nbirth; it only made labor harsh and birth full of sorrow. According to Genesis,\nman ( adorn ) had been created to take care and watch over the soil ( adamah ),\nas even his name, the masculine form of “soil,” indicates (see Gen. 2:5, 15).\n“And Adam was not to till adamah . . . and He, God, created Adam of the dust\nof adamah. . . . He, God, took Adam and put him into the garden of Eden to\ntill and to watch it” (I follow the translation of Martin Buber and Franz Rosen-\nzweig, Die Schrijt [Berlin, n.d.]). The word for “tilling” which later became the\nword for laboring in Hebrew, leawod, has the connotation of “to serve.” The\ncurse (3 : 17-19) does not mention this word, but the meaning is clear: the serv-\nice for which man was created now became servitude. The current popular mis-\nunderstanding of the curse is due to an unconscious interpretation of the Old\nTestament in the light of Greek thinking. The misunderstanding is usually avoid-\ned by Catholic writers. See, for instance, Jacques Leclercq, LeQons de droit naturel,\nVol. IV, Part 2, “Travail, Propriete,” (1946), p. 31: “La peine du travail est\nle resultat du peche original. . . . L'homme non dechu eut travaille dans la joie,\nmais il eftt travaille”; or J. Chr. Nattermann, Die moderne Arbeit , soziologisch und\ntheologisch betrachtet (1953), p. 9. It is interesting in this context to compare the\ncurse of the Old Testament with the seemingly similar explanation of the harsh-\nness of labor in Hesiod. Hesiod reports that the gods, in order to punish man, hid\nlife from him (see n. 8) so that he had to search for it, while before, he apparently\ndid not have to do anything but pluck the fruits of the earth from fields and\ntrees. Here the curse consists not only in the harshness of labor but in labor\nitself.\n\n\n[ 107 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nof subsistence, so that happiness is a concomitant of the process it-\nself, just as pleasure is a concomitant of the functioning of a\nhealthy body. The “happiness of the greatest number,” into which\nwe have generalized and vulgarized the felicity with which earthly\nlife has always been blessed, conceptualized into an “ideal” the\nfundamental reality of a laboring humanity. The right to the pur-\nsuit of this happiness is indeed as undeniable as the right to life; it\nis even identical with it. But it has nothing in common with good\nfortune, which is rare and never lasts and cannot be pursued, be-\ncause fortune depends on luck and what chance gives and takes,\nalthough most people in their “pursuit of happiness” run after good\nfortune and make themselves unhappy even when it befalls them,\nbecause they want to keep and enjoy luck as though it were an\ninexhaustible abundance of “good things.” There is no lasting hap-\npiness outside the prescribed cycle of painful exhaustion and pleas-\nurable regeneration, and whatever throws this cycle out of balance\n—poverty and misery where exhaustion is followed by wretched-\nness instead of regeneration, or great riches and an entirely effort-\nless life where boredom takes the place of exhaustion and where\nthe mills of necessity, of consumption and digestion, grind an im-\npotent human body mercilessly and barrenly to death — ruins the\nelemental happiness that comes from being alive.\n\nThe force of life is fertility. The living organism is not ex-\nhausted when it has provided for its own reproduction, and its\n“surplus” lies in its potential multiplication. Marx's consistent\nnaturalism discovered “labor power” as the specifically human\nmode of the life force which is as capable of creating a “surplus” as\nnature herself. Since he was almost exclusively interested in this\nprocess itself, the process of the “productive forces of society,” in\nwhose life, as in the life of every animal species, production and\nconsumption always strike a balance, the question of a separate\nexistence of worldly things, whose durability will survive and\nwithstand the devouring processes of life, does not occur to him at\nall. From the viewpoint of the life of the species, all activities in-\ndeed find their common denominator in laboring, and the only dis-\ntinguishing criterion left is the abundance or scarcity of the goods\nto be fed into the life process. When every thing has become an\nobject for consumption, the fact that labor's surplus does not\n\nr 108 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nchange the nature, the “short duration,” of the products them-\nselves loses all importance, and this loss is manifest in Marx's\nwork in the contempt with which he treats the belabored distinc-\ntions of his predecessors between productive and unproductive, or\nskilled and unskilled labor.\n\nThe reason why Marx's predecessors were not able to rid them-\nselves of these distinctions, which essentially are equivalent to the\nmore fundamental distinction between work and labor, was not\nthat they were less “scientific” but that they were still writing on\nthe assumption of private property, or at least individual appropria-\ntion of national wealth. For the establishment of property, mere\nabundance can never be enough; labor's products do not become\nmore durable by their abundance and cannot be “heaped up” and\nstored away to become part of a man's property; on the contrary,\nthey are only too likely to disappear in the process of appropria-\ntion or to “perish uselessly” if they are not consumed “before they\nspoil.”\n\n",
        "Section 15. THE PRIVACY OF PROPERTY AND WEALTH": "\nAt first glance it must seem strange indeed that a theory which so\nconclusively ended in the abolition of all property should have\ntaken its departure from the theoretical establishment of private\nproperty. This strangeness, however, is somewhat mitigated if we\nremember the sharply polemical aspect of the modern age's con-\ncern with property, whose rights were asserted explicitly against\nthe common realm and against the state. Since no political theory\nprior to socialism and communism had proposed to establish an\nentirely propertyless society, and no government prior to the\ntwentieth century had shown serious inclinations to expropriate\nits citizens, the content of the new theory could not possibly be\nprompted by the need to protect property rights against possible\nintrusion of government administration. The point is that then,\nunlike now when all property theories are obviously on the defen-\nsive, the economists were not on the defensive at all but on the\ncontrary openly hostile to the whole sphere of government, which\n\n[ 109 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nat best was considered a “necessary evil” and a “reflection on hu-\nman nature ,” 54 at worst a parasite on the otherwise healthy life of\nsociety . 55 What the modern age so heatedly defended was never\nproperty as such but the unhampered pursuit of more property or of\nappropriation; as against all organs that stood for the “dead” per-\nmanence of a common world, it fought its battles in the name of\nlife, the life of society.\n\nThere is no doubt that, as the natural process of life is located in\nthe body, there is no more immediately life-bound activity than\nlaboring. Locke could neither remain satisfied with the traditional\nexplanation of labor, according to which it is the natural and in-\nevitable consequence of poverty and never a means of its abolition,\nnor with the traditional explanation of the origin of property\nthrough acquisition, conquest, or an original division of the com-\nmon world . 66 What he actually was concerned with was appropria-\n\n54. The writers of the modern age are all agreed that the “good” and “pro-\nductive” side of human nature is reflected in society, while its wickedness makes\ngovernment necessary. As Thomas Paine stated it: “Society is produced by our\nwants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness\npositively hy uniting our affections, the latter negatively by restraining our\nvices. . . . Society in every state is a blessing, but government, even in the best\nstate, a necessary evil” ( Common Sense , 1776). Or Madison: “But what is gov-\nernment itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were\nangels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither\nexternal or internal controls would be necessary” (The Federalist [Modern Li-\nbrary ed.], p. 337).\n\n55. This was the opinion of Adam Smith, for instance, who was very indig-\nnant about “the public extravagance of government”: “The whole, or almost\nthe whole public revenue, is in most countries employed in maintaining unproduc-\ntive hands” (of. cit., I, 306) .\n\n56. No doubt, “before 1690 no one understood that a man had a natural right\nto property created by his labour; after 1690 the idea came to be an axiom of\nsocial science” (Richard Schlatter, Private Property: The History of an Idea [1951],\np. 1 56). The concept of labor and property was even mutually exclusive, where-\nas labor and poverty (fonos and penia, Arbeit and Armut) belonged together in\nthe sense that the activity corresponding to the status of poverty was laboring.\nPlato, therefore, who held that laboring slaves were “bad” because they were\nnot masters of the animal part within them, said almost the same about the status\nof poverty. The poor man is “not master of himself” (penes on kai heautou me\nbaton [Seventh Letter 3 51 A]). None of the classical writers ever thought of labor\nas a possible source of wealth. According to Cicero — and he probably only sums\n\n[ no ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\ntion and what he had to find was a world-appropriating activity\nwhose privacy at the same time must be beyond doubt and dispute.\n\nNothing, to be sure, is more private than the bodily functions of\nthe life process, its fertility not excluded, and it is quite note-\nworthy that the few instances where even a “socialized mankind”\nrespects and imposes strict privacy concern precisely such “activi-\nties” as are imposed by the life process itself. Of these, labor, be-\ncause it is an activity and not merely a function, is the least pri-\nvate, so to speak, the only one we feel need not be hidden; yet it is\nstill close enough to the life process to make plausible the argu-\nment for the privacy of appropriation as distinguished from the\nvery different argument for the privacy of property . 67 Locke\nfounded private property on the most privately owned thing there\nis, “the property [of man] in his own person,” that is, in his own\nbody . 68 “The labour of our body and the work of our hands”\nbecome one and the same, because both are the “means” to “ap-\npropriate” what “God . . . hath given ... to men in common.”\nAnd these means, body and hands and mouth, are the natural ap-\npropriators because they do not “belong to mankind in common”\nbut are given to each man for his private use . 69\n\nJust as Marx had to introduce a natural force, the “labor power”\nof the body, to account for labor's productivity and a progressing\nprocess of growing wealth, Locke, albeit less explicitly, had to\ntrace property to a natural origin of appropriation in order to force\nopen those stable, worldly boundaries that “enclose” each person's\nprivately owned share of the world “from the common .” 60 What\nMarx still had in common with Locke was that he wished to see\nthe process of growing wealth as a natural process, automatically\nfollowing its own laws and beyond wilful decisions and purposes.\nIf any human activity was to be involved in the process at all, it\ncould only be a bodily “activity” whose natural functioning could\nnot be checked even if one wanted to do so. To check these “activi-\n\n\nup contemporary opinion — property comes about either through ancient con-\nquest or victory or legal division (aut vetere occupcttione aut victoria aut lege [De\nofficiis i. 21]).\n\n57. See § 8 above. 59. Ibid., sec. 25.\n\n58. Op. cit., sec. 26. 60. Ibid., sec. 31.\n\n[ U1 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nties” is indeed to destroy nature, and for the whole modern age,\nwhether it holds fast to the institution of private property or con-\nsiders it to be an impediment to the growth of wealth, a check or\ncontrol of the process of wealth was equivalent to an attempt to\ndestroy the very life of society.\n\nThe development of the modern age and the rise of society,\nwhere the most private of all human activities, laboring, has be-\ncome public and been permitted to establish its own common\nrealm, may make it doubtful whether the very existence of prop-\nerty as a privately held place within the world can withstand the\nrelentless process of growing wealth. But it is true, nevertheless,\nthat the very privacy of one's holdings, that is, their complete inde-\npendence “from the common,” could not be better guaranteed than\nby the transformation of property into appropriation or by an in-\nterpretation of the “enclosure from the common” which sees it as\nthe result, the “product,” of bodily activity. In this aspect, the\nbody becomes indeed the quintessence of all property because it is\nthe only thing one could not share even if one wanted to. Nothing,\nin fact, is less common and less communicable, and therefore more\nsecurely shielded against the visibility and audibility of the public\nrealm, than what goes on within the confines of the body, its\npleasures and its pains, its laboring and consuming. Nothing, by\nthe same token, ejects one more radically from the world than\nexclusive concentration upon the body's life, a concentration forced\nupon man in slavery or in the extremity of unbearable pain. Who-\never wishes, for whatever reason, to make human existence en-\ntirely “private,” independent of the world and aware only of its\nown being alive, must rest his arguments on these experiences; and\nsince the relentless drudgery of slave labor is not “natural” but\nman-made and in contradiction to the natural fertility of the animal\nlaborans , whose strength is not exhausted and whose time is not\nconsumed when it has reproduced his own life, the “natural” ex-\nperience underlying the Stoic as well as the Epicurean independ-\nence of the world is not labor or slavery but pain. The happiness\nachieved in isolation from the world and enjoyed within the con-\nfines of one's own private existence can never be anything but the\nfamous “absence of pain,” a definition on which all variations of\nconsistent sensualism must agree. Hedonism, the doctrine that\n\n[ m ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nonly bodily sensations are real, is but the most radical form of a\nnon-political, totally private way of life, the true fulfilment of\nEpicurus' lathe biosas kai me politeuesthai (“live in hiding and do not\ncare about the world”).\n\nNormally, absence of pain is no more than the bodily condition\nfor experiencing the world; only if the body is not irritated and,\nthrough irritation, thrown back upon itself, can our bodily senses\nfunction normally, receive what is given to them. Absence of pain\nis usually “felt” only in the short intermediate stage between pain\nand non-pain, and the sensation which corresponds to the sen-\nsualists' concept of happiness is release from pain rather than its\nabsence. T he intensity of this sensation is beyond doubt; it is, in-\ndeed, matched only by the sensation of pain itself . 61 The mental\neffort required by philosophies which for various reasons wish to\n“liberate” man from the world is always an act of imagination in\nwhich the mere absence of pain is experienced and actualized into a\nfeeling of being released from it . 62\n\n61. It seems to me that certain types of mild and rather frequent drug addic-\ntions, which usually are blamed upon the habit-forming properties of drugs,\nmight perhaps be due to the desire to repeat the once experienced pleasure of\nrelief from pain with its intense feeling of euphoria. The phenomenon itself was\nwell known in antiquity, whereas in modern literature I found the only support\nfor my assumption in Isak Dinesen's “Converse at Night in Copenhagen” ( Last\nTales [1957], pp. 338 ff.), where she counts “cessation from pain” among the\n“three kinds of perfect happiness.” Plato already argues against those who\n“when drawn away from pain firmly believe that they have reached the goal of\n. . . pleasure” ( Republic 585A), but concedes that these “mixed pleasures”\nwhich follow pain or privation are more intense than the pure pleasures, such\nas smelling an exquisite aroma or contemplating geometrical figures. Curiously\nenough, it was the hedonists who confused the issue and did not want to admit\nthat the pleasure of release from pain is greater in intensity than “pure pleasure,”\nlet alone mere absence of pain. Thus Cicero accused Epicurus of having confused\nmere absence of pain with the pleasure of release from it (see V. Brochard,\nttudes de philosopkie ancienne et de philosophic modeme [1912], pp. 252 ff.). And\nLucretius exclaimed: “Do you not see that nature is clamouring for two things\nonly, a body free from pain, a mind released from worry . . . ?” {The Nature of\nthe Universe [Penguin ed.], p. 60).\n\n62. Brochard {op. cit .) gives an excellent summary of the philosophers of late\nantiquity, especially of Epicurus. The way to unshaken sensual happiness lies\nin the soul's capacity “to escape into a happier world which it creates, so that\n\n[ U3 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nIn any event, pain and the concomitant experience of release\nfrom pain are the only sense experiences that are so independent\nfrom the world that they do not contain the experience of any\nworldly object. The pain caused by a sword or the tickling caused\nby a feather indeed tells me nothing whatsoever of the quality or\neven the worldly existence of a sword or a feather . 63 Only an ir-\nresistible distrust in the capacity of human senses for an adequate\nexperience of the world — and this distrust is the origin of all\nspecifically modern philosophy— can explain the strange and even\n\nwith the help of imagination it can always persuade the body to experience the\nsame pleasure which it once has known” (pp. 278 and 294 ff.).\n\n63. It is characteristic of all theories that argue against the world-giving\ncapacity of the senses that they remove vision from its position as the highest\nand most noble of the senses and substitute touch or taste, which are indeed the\nmost private senses, that is, those in which the body primarily senses itself while\nperceiving an object. All thinkers who deny the reality of the outer world would\nhave agreed with Lucretius, who said: “For touch and nothing but touch (by\nall that men call holy) is the essence of all our bodily sensations” {op. cit., p.\n72). This, however, is not enough; touch or taste in a non-irritated body still\ngive too much of the reality of the world: when I eat a dish of strawberries, I\ntaste strawberries and not the taste itself, or, to take an example from Galileo,\nwhen “I pass a hand, first over a marble statue, then over a living man,” I am\naware of marble and a living body, and not primarily of my own hand that\ntouches them. Galileo, therefore, when he wishes to demonstrate that the sec-\nondary qualities, such as colors, tastes, odors, are “nothing else than mere names\n[having] their residence solely in the sensitive body,” has to give up his own\nexample and introduce the sensation of being tickled by a feather, whereupon\nhe concludes: “Of precisely a similar and not greater existence do I believe these\nvarious qualities to be possessed, which are attributed to natural bodies, such\nas tastes, odours, colours and others” {II Saggiatore, in Opere, IV, 333 ff.; transla-\ntion quoted from E. A. Burtt, Metaphysical Foundations of Modem Science [1932]) .\n\nThis argument can base itself only upon sense experiences in which the body\nis clearly thrown back upon itself and therefore, as it were, ejected from the\nworld in which it normally moves. The stronger the inner bodily sensation, the\nmore plausible becomes the argument. Descartes in the same line of argument\nsays as follows: “The motion merely of a sword cutting a part of our skin\ncauses pain but does not on that account make us aware of the motion or the\nfigure of the sword. And it is certain that this sensation of pain is not less different\nfrom the motion that causes it . . . than are the sensation we have of colour,\nsound, odour, or taste” ( Principles , Part 4; translated by Haldane and Ross,\nPhilosophical Works [1911]).\n\n\n[ 04 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nabsurd choice that uses phenomena which, like pain or tickling,\nobviously prevent our senses' functioning normally, as examples of\nall sense experience, and can derive from them the subjectivity of\n“secondary” and even “primary” qualities. If we had no other\nsense perceptions than these in which the body senses itself, the\nreality of the outer world would not only be open to doubt, we\nwould not even possess any notion of a world at all.\n\nThe only activity which corresponds strictly to the experience\nof worldlessness, or rather to the loss of world that occurs in pain,\nis laboring, where the human body, its activity notwithstanding, is\nalso thrown back upon itself, concentrates upon nothing but its\nown being alive, and remains imprisoned in its metabolism with\nnature without ever transcending or freeing itself from the re-\ncurring cycle of its own functioning. We mentioned before the\ntwofold pain connected with the life process for which language\nhas but one word and which according to the Bible was imposed\nupon the life of man together, the painful effort involved in the\nreproduction of one's own life and the life of the species. If this\npainful effort of living and fertility were the true origin of prop-\nerty, then the privacy of this property would be indeed as world -\nless as the unequaled privacy of having a body and of experiencing\npain.\n\nThis privacy, however, while it is essentially the privacy of ap-\npropriation, is by no means what Locke, whose concepts were still\nessentially those of the premodern tradition, understood by private\nproperty. No matter what its origin, this property was to him still\nan “enclosure from the common,” that is, primarily a place in the\nworld where that which is private can be hidden and protected\nagainst the public realm. As such, it remained in contact with the\ncommon world even at a time when growing wealth and appropria-\ntion began to threaten the common world with extinction. Prop-\nerty does not strengthen but rather mitigates the unrelatedness to\nthe world of the laboring process, because of its own worldly se-\ncurity. By the same token, the process character of laboring, the\nrelentlessness with which labor is urged and driven by the life\nprocess itself, is checked by the acquisition of property. In a so-\nciety of property-owners, as distinguished from a society of la-\n\n[ ns ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nborers or jobholders, it is still the world, and neither natural\nabundance nor the sheer necessity of life, which stands at the center\nof human care and worry.\n\nThe matter becomes altogether different if the leading interest is\nno longer property but the growth of wealth and the process of\naccumulation as such. This process can be as infinite as the life\nprocess of the species, and its very infinity is constantly challenged\nand interrupted by the inconvenient fact that private individuals do\nnot live forever and have no infinite time before them. Only if the\nlife of society as a whole, instead of the limited lives of individual\nmen, is considered to be the gigantic subject of the accumulation\nprocess can this process go on in full freedom and at full speed,\nunhampered by limitations imposed by the individual life-span and\nindividually held property. Only when man no longer acts as an\nindividual, concerned only with his own survival, but as a “member\nof the species,” a Gattungsivesen as Marx used to say, only when\nthe reproduction of individual life is absorbed into the life process\nof man-kind, can the collective life process of a “socialized man-\nkind” follow its own “necessity,” that is, its automatic course of\nfertility in the twofold sense of multiplication of lives and the\nincreasing abundance of goods needed by them.\n\nThe coincidence of Marx's labor philosophy with the evolution\nand development theories of the nineteenth century— the natural\nevolution of a single life process from the lowest forms of organic\nlife to the emergence of the human animal and the historical devel-\nopment of a life process of mankind as a whole — is striking and was\nearly observed by Engels, who called Marx “the Darwin of his-\ntory.” What all these theories in the various sciences — economics,\nhistory, biology, geology — have in common is the concept of proc-\ness, which was virtually unknown prior to the modern age. Since\nthe discovery of processes by the natural sciences had coincided\nwith the discovery of introspection in philosophy, it is only natural\nthat the biological process within ourselves should eventually be-\ncome the very model of the new concept; within the framework of\nexperiences given to introspection, we know of no other process\nbut the life process within our bodies, and the only activity into\nwhich we can translate it and which corresponds to it is labor.\n\n[ 116 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nHence, it may seem almost inevitable that the equation of produc-\ntivity with fertility in the labor philosophy of the modern age\nshould have been succeeded by the different varieties of life phi-\nlosophy which rest on the same equation . 64 The difference between\nthe earlier labor theories and the later life philosophies is chiefly\nthat the latter have lost sight of the only activity necessary to sus-\ntain the life process. Yet even this loss seems to correspond to the\nfactual historical development which made labor more effortless\nthan ever before and therefore even more similar to the automati-\ncally functioning life process. If at the turn of the century (with\nNietzsche and Bergson) life and not labor was proclaimed to be\n“the creator of all values,” this glorification of the sheer dynamism\nof the life process excluded that minimum of initiative present even\nin those activities which, like laboring and begetting, are urged\nupon man by necessity.\n\nHowever, neither the enormous increase in fertility nor the so-\ncialization of the process, that is, the substitution of society or col-\nlective man-kind for individual men as its subject, can eliminate the\ncharacter of strict and even cruel privacy from the experience of\nbodily processes in which life manifests itself, or from the activity\nof laboring itself. Neither abundance of goods nor the shortening of\nthe time actually spent in laboring are likely to result in the estab-\nlishment of a common world, and the expropriated animal laborans\nbecomes no less private because he has been deprived of a private\nplace of his own to hide and be protected from the common realm.\nMarx predicted correctly, though with an unjustified glee, “the\nwithering away” of the public realm under conditions of unham-\npered development of the “productive forces of society,” and he\nwas equally right, that is, consistent with his conception of man as\nan animal laborans , when he foresaw that “socialized men” would\n\n64. This connection was dimly perceived by Bergson's pupils in France (see\nesp. Edouard Berth, Les mefaits des intellectuels [1914], ch. 1, and Georges Sorel,\nD'Aristote a Marx [1935]). In the same school belongs the work of the Italian\nscholar Adriano Tilgher {op. cit.) who emphasizes that the idea of labor is central\nand constitutes the key to the new concept and image of life (English ed., p. 55).\nThe school of Bergson, like its master, idealizes labor by equating it with work\nand fabrication. Yet the similarity between the motor of biological life and\nBergson's elan vital is striking.\n\n\n[ U7 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nspend their freedom from laboring in those strictly private and es-\nsentially worldless activities that we now call “hobbies .” 66\n",
        "Section 16. THE INSTRUMENTS OF WORK AND THE DIVISION OF LABOR": "\nUnfortunately, it seems to be in the nature of the conditions of life\nas it has been given to man that the only possible advantage of the\nfertility of human labor power lies in its ability to procure the\nnecessities of life for more than one man or one family. Labor's\nproducts, the products of man's metabolism with nature, do not\nstay in the world long enough to become a part of it, and the labor-\ning activity itself, concentrated exclusively on life and its main-\ntenance, is oblivious of the world to the point of worldlessness.\nThe animal laborans, driven by the needs of its body, does not use\nthis body freely as homo faber uses his hands, his primordial tools,\nwhich is why Plato suggested that laborers and slaves were not\nonly subject to necessity and incapable of freedom but also unable\nto rule the “animal” part within them . 66 A mass society of la-\nborers, such as Marx had in mind when he spoke of “socialized\nmankind,” consists of worldless specimens of the species man-\nkind, whether they are household slaves, driven into their predica-\nment by the violence of others, or free, performing their functions\nwillingly.\n\nThis worldlessness of the animal laborans , to be sure, is entirely\ndifferent from the active flight from the publicity of the world\nwhich we found inherent in the activity of “good works.” The\nanimal laborans does not flee the world but is ejected from it in so\nfar as he is imprisoned in the privacy of his own body, caught in the\n\n65. In communist or socialist society, all professions would, as it were, be-\ncome hobbies: there would be no painters but only people who among other\nthings spend their time also on painting; people, that is, who “do this today and\nthat tomorrow, who hunt in the morning, go fishing in the afternoon, raise cattle\nin the evening, are critics after dinner, as they see fit, without for that matter\never becoming hunters, fisherman, shepherds or critics” ( Deutsche Ideologic, pp.\n22 and 373).\n\n66.

The fact that slavery and banishment into\nthe household was, by and large, the social condition of all laborers\nprior to the modern age is primarily due to the human condition\nitself; life, which for all other animal species is the very essence of\ntheir being, becomes a burden to man because of his innate “re-\npugnance to futility .” 67 This burden is all the heavier since none of\nthe so-called “loftier desires” has the same urgency, is actually\nforced upon man by necessity, as the elementary needs of life.\nSlavery became the social condition of the laboring classes because\nit was felt that it was the natural condition of life itself. Omnis vita\nservitium est. 6B\n\nThe burden of biological life, weighing down and consuming the\nspecifically human life-span between birth and death, can be elimi-\nnated only by the use of servants, and the chief function of ancient\nslaves was rather to carry the burden of consumption in the house-\nhold than to produce for society at large . 69 The reason why slave\nlabor could play such an enormous role in ancient societies and\nwhy its wastefulness and unproductivity were not discovered is that\nthe ancient city-state was primarily a “consumption center,”\nunlike medieval cities which were chiefly production centers . 70\nThe price for the elimination of life's burden from the shoulders of\nall citizens was enormous and by no means consisted only in the\nviolent injustice of forcing one part of humanity into the darkness\nof pain and necessity. Since this darkness is natural, inherent in the\nhuman condition — only the act of violence, when one group of men\ntries to rid itself of the shackles binding all of us to pain and neces-\nsity, is man-made — the price for absolute freedom from necessity\n\n67.

Under the conditions of slavery, the great of the earth\ncould even use their senses vicariously, could “see and hear\nthrough their slaves,” as the Greek idiom used by Herodotus\nexpressed it . 71\n\nOn its most elementary level the “toil and trouble” of obtaining\nand the pleasures of “incorporating” the necessities of life are so\nclosely bound together in the biological life cycle, whose recurrent\nrhythm conditions human life in its unique and unilinear move-\nment, that the perfect elimination of the pain and effort of labor\nwould not only rob biological life of its most natural pleasures but\ndeprive the specifically human life of its very liveliness and vital-\nity. The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just\nsymptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they\nare rather the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity\nto which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the “easy\nlife of the gods” would be a lifeless life.\n\nFor our trust in the reality of life and in the reality of the world\nis not the same. The latter derives primarily from the permanence\nand durability of the world, which is far superior to that of mortal\nlife. If one knew that the world would come to an end with or soon\nafter his own death, it would lose all its reality, as it did for the\nearly Christians as long as they were convinced of the immediate\nfulfilment of their eschatological expectations. Trust in the reality\nof life, on the contrary, depends almost exclusively on the intensity\nwith which life is felt, on the impact with which it makes itself felt.\nThis intensity is so great and its force so elementary that wherever\nit prevails, in bliss or sorrow, it blacks out all other worldly real-\nity. That the life of the rich loses in vitality, in closeness to the\n“good things” of nature, what it gains in refinement, in sensitivity\nto the beautiful things in the world, has often been noted. The fact\nis that the human capacity for life in the world always implies an\n\n71. Herodotus i. 113 for instance: tide te dia touton, and passim.

Barrow, Slavery in the Roman Empire [1928], p. 26). “We walk with\nalien feet; we see with alien eyes; we recognize and greet people with an alien\nmemory; we live from alien labor.”\n\n[ no ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nability to transcend and to be alienated from the processes of life\nitself, while vitality and liveliness can be conserved only to the\nextent that men are willing to take the burden, the toil and trouble\nof life, upon themselves.\n\nIt is true that the enormous improvement in our labor tools — the\nmute robots with which homo faber has come to the help of the\nanimal laborans , as distinguished from the human, speaking instru-\nments (the instrumentum vocale, as the slaves in ancient house-\nholds were called) whom the man of action had to rule and oppress\nwhen he wanted to liberate the animal laborans from its bondage —\nhas made the twofold labor of life, the effort of its sustenance and\nthe pain of giving birth, easier and less painful than it has ever\nbeen. This, of course, has not eliminated compulsion from the la-\nboring activity or the condition of being subject to need and neces-\nsity from human life. But, in distinction from slave society, where\nthe “curse” of necessity remained a vivid reality because the life of\na slave testified daily to the fact that “life is slavery,” this condi-\ntion is no longer fully manifest and its lack of appearance has made\nit much more difficult to notice and remember. The danger here is\nobvious. Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject\nto necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly\nsuccessful attempts to liberate himself from necessity. And while it\nmay be true that his strongest impulse toward this liberation comes\nfrom his “repugnance to futility,” it is also likely that the impulse\nmay grow weaker as this “futility” appears easier, as it requires\nless effort. For it is still probable that the enormous changes of the\nindustrial revolution behind us and the even greater changes of the\natomic revolution before us will remain changes of the world, and\nnot changes in the basic condition of human life on earth.\n\nTools and instruments which can ease the effort of labor con-\nsiderably are themselves not a product of labor but of work; they\ndo not belong in the process of consumption but are part and parcel\nof the world of use objects. Their role, no matter how great it\nmay be in the labor of any given civilization, can never attain the\nfundamental importance of tools for all kinds of work. No work\ncan be produced without tools, and the birth of homo faber and the\ncoming into being of a man-made world of things are actually\ncoeval with the discovery of tools and instruments. From the\n\n[ 121 }\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nstandpoint of labor, tools strengthen and multiply human strength\nto the point of almost replacing it, as in all cases where natural\nforces, such as tame animals or water power or electricity, and not\nmere material things, are brought under a human master. By the\nsame token, they increase the natural fertility of the animal laborans\nand provide an abundance of consumer goods. But all these changes\nare of a quantitative order, whereas the very quality of fabricated\nthings, from the simplest use object to the masterwork of art,\ndepends intimately on the existence of adequate instruments.\n\nMoreover, the limitations of instruments in the easing of life's\nlabor — the simple fact that the services of one servant can never be\nfully replaced by a hundred gadgets in the kitchen and half a dozen\nrobots in the cellar — are of a fundamental nature. A curious and\nunexpected testimony to this is that it could be predicted thousands\nof years before the fabulous modern development of tools and ma-\nchines had taken place. In a half-fanciful, half-ironical mood, Aris-\ntotle once imagined what has long since become a reality, namely\nthat “every tool could perform its own work when ordered . . .\nlike the statues of Daedalus or the tripods of Hephaestus, which,\nsays the poet, ‘of their own accord entered the assembly of the\ngods.' ” Then, “the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch\nthe lyre without a hand to guide them.” This, he goes on to say,\nwould indeed mean that the craftsman would no longer need human\nassistants, but it would not mean that household slaves could be\ndispensed with. For slaves are not instruments of making things or\nof production, but of living, which constantly consumes their serv-\nices . 72 The process of making a thing is limited and the function of\nthe instrument comes to a predictable, controllable end with the\nfinished product; the process of life that requires laboring is an\nendless activity and the only “instrument” equal to it would have\nto be a perpetuum mobile , that is, the instrumentum vocale which is\nas alive and “active” as the living organism which it serves. It is\nprecisely because from “the instruments of the household nothing\nelse results except the use of the possession itself” that they cannot\nbe replaced by tools and instruments of workmanship “from which\nresults something more than the mere use of the instrument .” 73\n\n72. Aristotle Politics 1253b30-1254al8.\n\n73. Winston Ashley, op. cit., ch. 5.\n\n[ 122 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nWhile tools and instruments, designed to produce more and\nsomething altogether different from their mere use, are of second-\nary importance for laboring, the same is not true for the other great\nprinciple in the human labor process, the division of labor. Division\nof labor indeed grows directly out of the laboring process and\nshould not be mistaken for the apparently similar principle of spe-\ncialization which prevails in working processes and with which it\nis usually equated. Specialization of work and division of labor\nhave in common only the general principle of organization, which\nitself has nothing to do with either work or labor but owes its\norigin to the strictly political sphere of life, to the fact of man's\ncapacity to act and to act together and in concert. Only within the\nframework of political organization, where men not merely live,\nbut act, together, can specialization of work and division of labor\ntake place.\n\nYet, while specialization of work is essentially guided by the\nfinished product itself, whose nature it is to require different skills\nwhich then are pooled and organized together, division of labor, on\nthe contrary, presupposes the qualitative equivalence of all single\nactivities for which no special skill is required, and these activities\nhave no end in themselves, but actually represent only certain\namounts of labor power which are added together in a purely quan-\ntitative way. Division of labor is based on the fact that two men\ncan put their labor power together and “behave toward each other\nas though they were one .” 74 This one-ness is the exact opposite of\nco-operation, it indicates the unity of the species with regard to\nwhich every single member is the same and exchangeable. (The\nformation of a labor collective where the laborers are socially or-\nganized in accordance with this principle of common and divisible\nlabor power is the very opposite of the various workmen's or-\nganizations, from the old guilds and corporations to certain types\nof modern trade unions, whose members are bound together by the\nskills and specializations that distinguish them from others.) Since\n\n74. See Viktor von Weizsacker, “Zum Begriff der Arbeit,” in Festschrift fur\nAlfred Weber (1948), p. 739. The essay is noteworthy for certain scattered ob-\nservations, but on the whole unfortunately useless, since Weizsacker further\nobscures the concept of labor by the rather gratuitous assumption that the sick\nhuman being has to “perform labor” in order to get well.\n\n[ 123 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nnone of the activities into which the process is divided has an end in\nitself, their “natural” end is exactly the same as in the case of\n“undivided” labor: either the simple reproduction of the means of\nsubsistence, that is, the capacity for consumption of the laborers,\nor the exhaustion of human labor power. Neither of these two limi-\ntations, however, is final; exhaustion is part of the individual's, not\nof the collective's, life process, and the subject of the laboring\nprocess under the conditions of division of labor is a collective\nlabor force, not individual labor power. The inexhaustibility of\nthis labor force corresponds exactly to the deathlessness of the\nspecies, whose life process as a whole is also not interrupted by the\nindividual births and deaths of its members.\n\nMore serious, it seems, is the limitation imposed by the capacity\nto consume, which remains bound to the individual even when a\ncollective labor force has replaced individual labor power. The\nprogress of accumulation of wealth may be limitless in a “social-\nized mankind” which has rid itself of the limitations of individual\nproperty and overcome the limitation of individual appropriation\nby dissolving all stable wealth, the possession of “heaped up” and\n“stored away” things, into money to spend and consume. We al-\nready live in a society where wealth is reckoned in terms of earn-\ning and spending power, which are only modifications of the two-\nfold metabolism of the human body. The problem therefore is how\nto attune individual consumption to an unlimited accumulation of\nwealth.\n\nSince mankind as a whole is still very far from having reached\nthe limit of abundance, the mode in which society may overcome\nthis natural limitation of its own fertility can be perceived only\ntentatively and on a national scale. There, the solution seems to be\nsimple enough. It consists in treating all use objects as though they\nwere consumer goods, so that a chair or a table is now consumed\nas rapidly as a dress and a dress used up almost as quickly as food.\nThis mode of intercourse with the things of the world, moreover,\nis perfectly adequate to the way they are produced. The industrial\nrevolution has replaced all workmanship with labor, and the result\nhas been that the things of the modern world have become labor\nproducts whose natural fate is to be consumed, instead of work\nproducts which are there to be used. Just as tools and instruments,\n\n[ 124 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nthough originating from work, were always employed in labor\nprocesses as well, so the division of labor, entirely appropriate and\nattuned to the laboring process, has become one of the chief char-\nacteristics of modern work processes, that is, of the fabrication and\nproduction of use objects. Division of labor rather than increased\nmechanization has replaced the rigorous specialization formerly\nrequired for all workmanship. Workmanship is required only for\nthe design and fabrication of models before they go into mass pro-\nduction, which also depends on tools and machinery. But mass\nproduction would, in addition, be altogether impossible without\nthe replacement of workmen and specialization with laborers and\nthe division of labor.\n\nTools and instruments ease pain and effort and thereby change\nthe modes in which the urgent necessity inherent in labor once was\nmanifest to all. They do not change the necessity itself; they only\nserve to hide it from our senses. Something similar is true of labor's\nproducts, which do not become more durable through abundance.\nThe case is altogether different in the corresponding modern trans-\nformation of the work process by the introduction of the principle\nof division of labor. Here the very nature of work is changed and\nthe production process, although it by no means produces objects\nfor consumption, assumes the character of labor. Although ma-\nchines have forced us into an infinitely quicker rhythm of repeti-\ntion than the cycle of natural processes prescribed — and this spe-\ncifically modern acceleration is only too apt to make us disregard\nthe repetitive character of all laboring — the repetition and the end-\nlessness of the process itself put the unmistakable mark of laboring\nupon it. This is even more evident in the use objects produced by\nthese techniques of laboring. Their very abundance transforms\nthem into consumer goods. The endlessness of the laboring process\nis guaranteed by the ever-recurrent needs of consumption; the end-\nlessness of production can be assured only if its products lose their\nuse character and become more and more objects of consumption,\nor if, to put it in another way, the rate of use is so tremendously\naccelerated that the objective difference between use and consump-\ntion, between the relative durability of use objects and the swift\ncoming and going of consumer goods, dwindles to insignificance.\n\nIn our need for more and more rapid replacement of the worldly\n\n[ 125 ]\n\n\nthings around us, we can no longer afford to use them, to respect\nand preserve their inherent durability; we must consume, devour,\nas it were, our houses and furniture and cars as though they were\nthe “good things” of nature which spoil uselessly if they are not\ndrawn swiftly into the never-ending cycle of man's metabolism\nwith nature. It is as though we had forced open the distinguishing\nboundaries which protected the world, the human artifice, from\nnature, the biological process which goes on in its very midst as\nwell as the natural cyclical processes which surround it, deliver-\ning and abandoning to them the always threatened stability of a\nhuman world.\n\nThe ideals of homo faber , the fabricator of the world, which are\npermanence, stability, and durability, have been sacrificed to abun-\ndance, the ideal of the animal laborans. We live in a laborers' society\nbecause only laboring, with its inherent fertility, is likely to bring\nabout abundance; and we have changed work into laboring, broken\nit up into its minute particles until it has lent itself to division\nwhere the common denominator of the simplest performance is\nreached in order to eliminate from the path of human labor power\n— which is part of nature and perhaps even the most powerful of\nall natural forces— the obstacle of the “unnatural” and purely\nworldly stability of the human artifice.\n\n",
        "Section 17. A consumers' society": "\nIt is frequently said that we live in a consumers' society, and since,\nas we saw, labor and consumption are but two stages of the same\nprocess, imposed upon man by the necessity of life, this is only\nanother way of saying that we live in a society of laborers. This\nsociety did not come about through the emancipation of the labor-\ning classes but by the emancipation of the laboring activity itself,\nwhich preceded by centuries the political emancipation of laborers.\nThe point is not that for the first time in history laborers were ad-\nmitted and given equal rights in the public realm, but that we have\nalmost succeeded in leveling all human activities to the common\ndenominator of securing the necessities of life and providing for\ntheir abundance. Whatever we do, we are supposed to do for the\n\n[ 126 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nsake of “making a living” ; such is the verdict of society, and the\nnumber of people, especially in the professions who might chal-\nlenge it, has decreased rapidly. The only exception society is\nwilling to grant is the artist, who, strictly speaking, is the only\n“worker” left in a laboring society. The same trend to level down\nall serious activities to the status of making a living is manifest in\npresent-day labor theories, which almost unanimously define labor\nas the opposite of play. As a result, all serious activities, irrespec-\ntive of their fruits, are called labor, and every activity which is not\nnecessary either for the life of the individual or for the life process\nof society is subsumed under playfulness . 75 In these theories,\n\nIS. Although this labor-play category appears at first glance to be so general\nas to be meaningless, it is characteristic in another respect: the real opposite\nunderlying it is the opposition of necessity and freedom, and it is indeed remark-\nable to see how plausible it is for modern thinking to consider playfulness to be\nthe source of freedom. Aside from this generalization, the modern idealizations\nof labor may be said to fall roughly into the following categories: (1) Labor is\na means to attain a higher end. This is generally the Catholic position, which\nhas the great merit of not being able to escape from reality altogether, so that\nthe intimate connections between labor and life and between labor and pain are\nusually at least mentioned. One outstanding representative is Jacques Leclercq of\nLouvain, especially his discussion of labor and property in Lemons de droit naturel\n(1946), Vol. IV, Part 2. (2) Labor is an act of shaping in which “a given struc-\nture is transformed into another, higher structure.” This is the central thesis of\nthe famous work by Otto Lipmann, Grundriss der Arbeitswissenschaft (1926) .\n(3) Labor in a laboring society is pure pleasure or “can be made fully as satisfy-\ning as leisure-time activities” (see Glen W. Cleeton, Making Work Human\n[1949]). This position is taken today by Corrado Gini in his Ecconomica Lavoris-\nta (1954), who considers the United States to be a “laboring society” (societa\nlavorista) where “labor is a pleasure and where all men want to labor.” (For a\nsummary of his position in German see Zeitschrift fur die gesamte Staatswissen-\nschaft, CIX [1953] and CX [1954].) This theory, incidentally, is less new than\nit seems. It was first formulated by F. Nitti (“Le travail humain et ses lois,”\nRevue Internationale de sociologie [1895]), who even then maintained that the\n“idea that labor is painful is a psychological rather than a physiological fact,”\nso that pain will disappear in a society where everybody works. (4) Labor,\nfinally, is man's confirmation of himself against nature, which is brought under\nhis domination through labor. This is the assumption which underlies— explicitly\nor implicitly — the new, especially French trend of a humanism of labor. Its\nbest-known representative is Georges Friedmann.\n\nAfter all these theories and academic discussions, it is rather refreshing to\nlearn that a large majority of workers, if asked “why does man work?” answer\n\n[ 127 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhich by echoing the current estimate of a laboring society on the\ntheoretical level sharpen it and drive it into its inherent extreme,\nnot even the “work” of the artist is left; it is dissolved into play\nand has lost its worldly meaning. The playfulness of the artist is\nfelt to fulfil the same function in the laboring life process of society\nas the playing of tennis or the pursuit of a hobby fulfils in the life of\nthe individual. The emancipation of labor has not resulted in an\nequality of this activity with the other activities of the vita activa ,\nbut in its almost undisputed predominance. From the standpoint of\n“making a living,” every activity unconnected with labor becomes\na “hobby .” 76\n\nIn order to dispel the plausibility of this self-interpretation of\nmodern man, it may be well to remember that all civilizations prior\nto our own would rather have agreed with Plato that the “art of\nearning money” (techne misthametike) is entirely unconnected with\nthe actual content even of such arts as medicine, navigation, or\narchitecture, which were attended by monetary rewards. It was\nin order to explain this monetary reward, which obviously is of an\naltogether different nature from health, the object of medicine, or\nthe erection of buildings, the object of architecture, that Plato in-\n\ntroduced one more art to accompany them all. This additional art\nis by no means understood as the element of labor in the otherwise\nfree arts, but, on the contrary, the one art through which the\n“artist,” the professional worker, as we would say, keeps himself\nfree from the necessity to labor . 77 This art is in the same category\n\nsimply “in order to be able to live'' or “to make money” (see Helmut Schelsky,\nArbeiterjugend Gestem und Heute [1955], whose publications are remarkably free\nof prejudices and idealizations) .\n\n76. The role of the hobby in modem labor society is quite striking and may\nbe the root of experience in the labor-play theories. What is especially note-\nworthy in this context is that Marx, who had no inkling of this development,\nexpected that in his utopian, laborless society all activities would be performed\nin a manner which very closely resembles the manner of hobby activities.\n\n77. Republic 346. Therefore, “the art of acquisition wards off poverty as\nmedicine wards off disease” ( Gorgias 478). Since payment for their services was\nvoluntary (Loening, op. cit.), the liberal professions must indeed have attained a\nremarkable perfection in the “art of making money.”\n\n[ 128 ]\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nwith the art required of the master of a household who must know\nhow to exert authority and use violence in his rule over slaves. Its\naim is to remain free from having “to make a living,” and the aims\nof the other arts are even farther removed from this elementary\nnecessity.\n\nThe emancipation of labor and the concomitant emancipation of\nthe laboring classes from oppression and exploitation certainly\nmeant progress in the direction of non-violence. It is much less cer-\ntain that it was also progress in the direction of freedom. No man-\nexerted violence, except the violence used in torture, can match\nthe natural force with which necessity itself compels. It is for this\nreason that the Greeks derived their word for torture from neces-\nsity, calling it anagkai, and not from bia, used for violence as ex-\nerted by man over man, just as this is the reason for the historical\nfact that throughout occidental antiquity torture, the “necessity no\nman can withstand,” could be applied only to slaves, who were\nsubject to necessity anyhow . 78 It was the arts of violence, the arts\nof war, piracy, and ultimately absolute rule, which brought the\ndefeated into the services of the victors and thereby held necessity\nin abeyance for the longer period of recorded history . 79 The mod-\nem age, much more markedly than Christianity, has brought about\n—together with its glorification of labor — a tremendous degrada-\ntion in the estimation of these arts and a less great but not less im-\nportant actual decrease in the use of the instruments of violence in\n\n78. The current modern explanation of this custom which was characteristic\nof the whole of Greek and Latin antiquity — that its origin is to be found in “the\nbelief that the slave is unable to tell the truth except on the rack” (Barrow, op.\ncit., p. 31) — is quite erroneous. The belief, on the contrary, is that nobody can\ninvent a lie under torture: “On croyait recueillir la voix meme de la nature dans\nles cris de la douleur. Plus la douleur penetrait avant, plus intime et plus vrai\nsembla etre ce temoignage de la chair et du sang” (Wallon, op. cit., I, 325).\nAncient psychology was much more aware than we are of the element of free-\ndom, of free invention, in telling lies. The “necessities” of torture were sup-\nposed to destroy this freedom and therefore could not be applied to free citizens.\n\n79. The older of the Greek words for slaves, douloi and dmoes, still signify\nthe defeated enemy. About wars and the sale of prisoners of war as the chief\nsource of slavery in antiquity, see W. L. Westermann, “Sklaverei,” in Pauly-\nWissowa.\n\n\n[ 129 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nhuman affairs generally . 80 The elevation of labor and the necessity\ninherent in the laboring metabolism with nature appear to be inti-\nmately connected with the downgrading of all activities which\neither spring directly from violence, as the use of force in human\nrelations, or harbor an element of violence within themselves,\nwhich, as we shall see, is the case for all workmanship. It is as\nthough the growing elimination of violence throughout the modern\nage almost automatically opened the doors for the re-entry of ne-\ncessity on its most elementary level. What already happened once\nin our history, in the centuries of the declining Roman Empire, may\nbe happening again. Even then, labor became an occupation of the\nfree classes, “only to bring to them the obligations of the servile\nclasses .” 81\n\nThe danger that the modern age's emancipation of labor will not\nonly fail to usher in an age of freedom for all but will result, on the\ncontrary, in forcing all mankind for the first time under the yoke of\nnecessity, was already clearly perceived by Marx when he in-\nsisted that the aim of a revolution could not possibly be the al-\nready-accomplished emancipation of the laboring classes, but must\nconsist in the emancipation of man from labor. At first glance, this\naim seems utopian, and the only strictly utopian element in Marx's\n\n80. Today, because of the new developments of instruments of war and de-\nstruction, we are likely to overlook this rather important trend in the modem\nage. As a matter of fact, the nineteenth century was one of the most peaceful\ncenturies in history.\n\n81. Wallon, op. cit., Ill, 265. Wallon shows brilliantly how the late Stoic\ngeneralization that all men are slaves rested on the development of the Roman\nEmpire, where the old freedom was gradually abolished by the imperial govern-\nment, so that eventually nobody was free and everybody had his master. The\nturning point is when first Caligula and then Trajan consented to being called\ndominus, a word formerly used only for the master of the household. The so-\ncalled slave morality of late antiquity and its assumption that no real difference\nexisted between the life of a slave and that of a free man had a very realistic\nbackground. Now the slave could indeed tell his master: Nobody is free, every-\nbody has a master. In the words of Wallon: “Les condamnes aux mines ont pour\nconfreres, a un moindre degre de peine, les condamnes aux moulins, aux boulan-\ngeries, aux relais publics, a tout autre travail faisant l'objet d'une corporation\nparticuliere” (p. 216). “C'est Ie droit de l'esclavage qui gouveme maintenant le\ncitoyen; et nous avons retrouve toute la legislation propre aux esclaves dans les\nreglements qui concernent sa personne, sa famille ou ses biens” (pp. 219-20).\n\n[ no ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nteachings . 82 Emancipation from labor, in Marx's own terms, is\nemancipation from necessity, and this would ultimately mean\nemancipation from consumption as well, that is, from the metabo-\nlism with nature which is the very condition of human life . 83 Yet\nthe developments of the last decade, and especially the possibilities\nopened up through the further development of automation, give us\nreason to wonder whether the utopia of yesterday will not turn\ninto the reality of tomorrow, so that eventually only the effort of\nconsumption will be left of “the toil and trouble” inherent in the\nbiological cycle to whose motor human life is bound.\n\nHowever, not even this utopia could change the essential\nworldly futility of the life process. The two stages through which\nthe ever-recurrent cycle of biological life must pass, the stages of\nlabor and consumption, may change their proportion even to the\npoint where nearly all human “labor power” is spent in consuming,\nwith the concomitant serious social problem of leisure, that is,\nessentially the problem of how to provide enough opportunity for\ndaily exhaustion to keep the capacity for consumption intact . 84\n\n82. The classless and stateless society of Marx is not utopian. Quite apart\nfrom the fact that modern developments have an unmistakable tendency to do\naway with class distinctions in society and to replace government by that “ad-\nministration of things” which according to Engels was to be the hallmark of\nsocialist society, these ideals in Marx himself were obviously conceived in\naccordance with Athenian democracy, except that in communist society the\nprivileges of the free citizens were to be extended to all.\n\n83. It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that Simone Weil's La condition\nouvriere (1951) is the only book in the huge literature on the labor question\nwhich deals with the problem without prejudice and sentimentality. She chose\nas the motto for her diary, relating from day to day her experiences in a factory,\nthe line from Homer: poll' aekadzamerie , kratere d'epikeiset' amgke (“much against\nyour own will, since necessity lies more mightily upon you”), and concludes\nthat the hope for an eventual liberation from labor and necessity is the only\nutopian element of Marxism and at the same time the actual motor of all Marx-\ninspired revolutionary labor movements. It is the “opium of the people” which\nMarx had believed religion to be.\n\n84. This leisure, needless to say, is not at all the same, as current opinion\nhas it, as the skhole of antiquity, which was not a phenomenon of consumption,\n“conspicuous” or not, and did not come about through the emergence of “spare\ntime” saved from laboring, but was on the contrary a conscious “abstention\nfrom” all activities connected with mere being alive, the consuming activity no\nless than the laboring. The touchstone of this skhole, as distinguished from the\n\n[ 131 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nPainless and effortless consumption would not change but would\nonly increase the devouring character of biological life until a man-\nkind altogether “liberated” from the shackles of pain and effort\nwould be free to “consume” the whole world and to reproduce\ndaily all things it wished to consume. How many things would\nappear and disappear daily and hourly in the life process of such a\nsociety would at best be immaterial for the world, if the world and\nits thing-character could withstand the reckless dynamism of a\nwholly motorized life process at all. The danger of future automa-\ntion is less the much deplored mechanization and artificialization of\nnatural life than that, its artificiality notwithstanding, all human\nproductivity would be sucked into an enormously intensified life\nprocess and would follow automatically, without pain or effort, its\never-recurrent natural cycle. The rhythm of machines would mag-\nnify and intensify the natural rhythm of life enormously, but it\nwould not change, only make more deadly, life's chief character\nwith respect to the world, which is to wear down durability.\n\nIt is a long way from the gradual decrease of working hours,\nwhich has progressed steadily for nearly a century, to this utopia.\nThe progress, moreover, has been rather overrated, because it was\nmeasured against the quite exceptionally inhuman conditions of\nexploitation prevailing during the early stages of capitalism. If we\nthink in somewhat longer periods, the total yearly amount of indi-\nvidual free time enjoyed at present appears less an achievement of\nmodernity than a belated approximation to normality . 86 In this as\n\nmodern ideal of leisure, is the well-known and frequently described frugality of\nGreek life in the classical period. Thus, it is characteristic that the maritime\ntrade, which more than anything else was responsible for wealth in Athens, was\nfelt to be suspect, so that Plato, following Hesiod, recommended the founda-\ntion of new city-states far away from the sea.\n\n85. During the Middle Ages, it is estimated that one hardly worked more\nthan half of the days of the year. Official holidays numbered 141 days (see Le-\nvasseur, op. cit., p. 329; see also Liesse, Le Travail [1899], p. 253, for the num-\nber of working days in France before the Revolution). The monstrous extension\nof the working day is characteristic of the beginning of the industrial revolu-\ntion, when the laborers had to compete with newly introduced machines. Before\nthat, the length of the working day amounted to eleven or twelve hours in fif-\nteenth-century England and to ten hours in the seventeenth (see H. Herkner,\n“Arbeitszeit,” in Handworterbuch fiir die Staatsvoissenschaft [1923], I, 889 ff.). In\n\n[ 132 ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nin other respects, the specter of a true consumers' society is more\nalarming as an ideal of present-day society than as an alr eady exist-\ning reality. The ideal is not new; it was clearly indicated in the\nunquestioned assumption of classical political economy that the\nultimate goal of the vita activa is growing wealth, abundance, and\nthe “happiness of the greatest number.” And what else, finally, is\nthis ideal of modern society but the age-old dream of the poor and\ndestitute, which can have a charm of its own so long as it is a\ndream, but turns into a fool's paradise as soon as it is realized.\n\nThe hope that inspired Marx and the best men of the various\nworkers' movements— that free time eventually will emancipate\nmen from necessity and make the animal laborans productive —\nrests on the illusion of a mechanistic philosophy which assumes that\nlabor power, like any other energy, can never be lost, so that if it is\nnot spent and exhausted in the drudgery of life it will automatically\nnourish other, “higher,” activities. The guiding model of this hope\nin Marx was doubtless the Athens of Pericles which, in the future,\nwith the help of the vastly increased productivity of human labor,\nwould need no slaves to sustain itself but would become a reality\nfor all. A hundred years after Marx we know the fallacy of this\nreasoning; the spare time of the animal laborans is never spent in\nanything but consumption, and the more time left to him, the\ngreedier and more craving his appetites. That these appetites be-\ncome more sophisticated, so that consumption is no longer re-\nstricted to the necessities but, on the contrary, mainly concen-\ntrates on the superfluities of life, does not change the character of\nthis society, but harbors the grave danger that eventually no object\nof the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation\nthrough consumption.\n\nThe rather uncomfortable truth of the matter is that the triumph\n\nbrief, “les travailleurs ont connu, pendant la premiere moiti^ du 19e siecle, des\nconditions d'existences pires que celles subies auparavant par les pins infortunes”\n(Edouard Dolleans, Histoire du travail en France [1953]). The extent of progress\nachieved in our time is generally overrated, since we measure it against a very\n“dark age” indeed. It may, for instance, be that the life expectancy of the most\nhighly civilized countries today corresponds only to the life expectancy in cer-\ntain centuries of antiquity. We do not know, of course, but a reflection upon the\nage of death in the biographies of famous people invites this suspicion.\n\n[ 133 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe modern world has achieved over necessity is due to the emanci-\npation of labor, that is, to the fact that the animal laborans was per-\nmitted to occupy the public realm; and yet, as long as the animal\nlaborans remains in possession of it, there can be no true public\nrealm, but only private activities displayed in the open. The out-\ncome is what is euphemistically called mass culture, and its deep-\nrooted trouble is a universal unhappiness, due on one side to the\ntroubled balance between laboring and consumption and, on the\nother, to the persistent demands of the animal laborans to obtain a\nhappiness which can be achieved only where life's processes of\nexhaustion and regeneration, of pain and release from pain, strike a\nperfect balance. The universal demand for happiness and the wide-\nspread unhappiness in our society (and these are but two sides of\nthe same coin) are among the most persuasive signs that we have\nbegun to live in a labor society which lacks enough laboring to\nkeep it contented. For only the animal laborans, and neither the\ncraftsman nor the man of action, has ever demanded to be “happy”\nor thought that mortal men could be happy.\n\nOne of the obvious danger signs that we may be on our way to\nbring into existence the ideal of the animal laborans is the extent to\nwhich our whole economy has become a waste economy, in which\nthings must be almost as quickly devoured and discarded as they\nhave appeared in the world, if the process itself is not to come to a\nsudden catastrophic end. But if the ideal were already in existence\nand we were truly nothing but members of a consumers' society,\nwe would no longer live in a world at all but simply be driven by\na process in whose ever-recurring cycles things appear and dis-\nappear, manifest themselves and vanish, never to last long enough\nto surround the life process in their midst.\n\nThe world, the man-made home erected on earth and made of\nthe material which earthly nature delivers into human hands, con-\nsists not of things that are consumed but of things that are used.\nIf nature and the earth generally constitute the condition of human\nlife , then the world and the things of the world constitute the condi-\ntion under which this specifically human life can be at home on\nearth. Nature seen through the eyes of the animal laborans is the\ngreat provider of all “good things,” which belong equally to all her\nchildren, who “take [them] out of [her] hands” and “mix with”\n\n[ I* ]\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\nthem in labor and consumption . 86 The same nature seen through\nthe eyes of homo faber, the builder of the world, “furnishes only the\nalmost worthless materials as in themselves,” whose whole value\nlies in the work performed upon them . 87 Without taking things out\nof nature's hands and consuming them, and without defending him-\nself against the natural processes of growth and decay, the animal\nlaborans could never survive. But without being at home in the\nmidst of things whose durability makes them fit for use and for\nerecting a world whose very permanence stands in direct contrast\nto life, this life would never be human.\n\nThe easier that life has become in a consumers' or laborers' so-\nciety, the more difficult it will be to remain aware of the urges of\nnecessity by which it is driven, even when pain and effort, the\noutward manifestations of necessity, are hardly noticeable at all.\nThe danger is that such a society, dazzled by the abundance of its\ngrowing fertility and caught in the smooth functioning of a never-\nending process, would no longer be able to recognize its own futil-\nity— the futility of a life which “does not fix or realize itself in any\npermanent subject which endures after [its] labour is past .” 88\n\n86.

    "CHAPTER 4. Work": {
        "Section 18. THE DURABILITY OF THE WORLD": "\nThe work of our hands, as distinguished from the labor of our\nbodies — homofaber who makes and literally “works upon ” 1 as dis-\ntinguished from the animal laborans which labors and “mixes with”\n— fabricates the sheer unending variety of things whose sum total\nconstitutes the human artifice. They are mostly, but not exclu-\nsively, objects for use and they possess the durability Locke\nneeded for the establishment of property, the “value” Adam Smith\nneeded for the exchange market, and they bear testimony to pro-\nductivity, which Marx believed to be the test of human nature.\nTheir proper use does not cause them to disappear and they give\nthe human artifice the stability and solidity without which it could\nnot be relied upon to house the unstable and mortal creature which\nis man.\n\nThe durability of the human artifice is not absolute; the use we\nmake of it, even though we do not consume it, uses it up. The life\nprocess which permeates our whole being invades it, too, and if we\ndo not use the things of the world, they also will eventually decay,\nreturn into the over-all natural process from which they were\n\n1. The Latin word faber, probably related to facert (“to make something”\nin the sense of production), originally designated the fabricator and artist who\nworks upon hard material, such as stone or wood; it also was used as translation\nfor the Greek tekton, which has the same connotation. The word fabri, often fol-\nlowed by tignarii, especially designates construction workers and carpenters. I\nhave been unable to ascertain when and where the expression homo faber, certainly\nof modern, postmedieval origin, first appeared. Jean Leclercq (“Vers la socle te\nbasee sur le travail,” Revue du travail, Vol. LI, No. 3 [March, 1950]) suggests\nthat only Bergson “threw the concept of homofaber into the circulation of ideas.”\n\n[ 136 ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\ndrawn and against which they were erected. If left to itself or dis-\ncarded from the human world, the chair will again become wood,\nand the wood will decay and return to the soil from which the tree\nsprang before it was cut off to become the material upon which to\nwork and with which to build. But though this may be the unavoid-\nable end of all single things in the world, the sign of their being\nproducts of a mortal maker, it is not so certainly the eventual fate\nof the human artifice itself, where all single things can be con-\nstantly replaced with the change of generations which come and\ninhabit the man-made world and go away. Moreover, while usage\nis bound to use up these objects, this end is not their destiny in the\nsame way as destruction is the inherent end of all things for con-\nsumption. What usage wears out is durability.\n\nIt is this durability which gives the things of the world their\nrelative independence from men who produced and use them, their\n“objectivity” which makes them withstand, “stand against ” 2 and\nendure, at least for a time, the voracious needs and wants of their\nliving makers and users. From this viewpoint, the things of the\nworld have the function of stabilizing human life, and their objec-\ntivity lies in the fact that — in contradiction to the Heraclitean\nsaying that the same man can never enter the same stream— men,\ntheir ever-changing nature notwithstanding, can retrieve their\nsameness, that is, their identity, by being related to the same chair\nand the same table. In other words, against the subjectivity of men\nstands the objectivity of the man-made world rather than the sub-\nlime indifference of an untouched nature, whose overwhelming\nelementary force, on the contrary, will compel them to swing re-\nlentlessly in the circle of their own biological movement, which\nfits so closely into the over-all cyclical movement of nature's\nhousehold. Only we who have erected the objectivity of a world of\nour own from what nature gives us, who have built it into the\nenvironment of nature so that we are protected from her, can look\nupon nature as something “objective.” Without a world between\nmen and nature, there is eternal movement, but no objectivity.\n\nAlthough use and consumption, like work and labor, are not the\n\n2. This is implied in the Latin verb obicere, from which our “object” is a late\nderivation, and in the German word for object, Gegenstand. “Object” means,\nliterally, “something thrown” or “put against.”\n\n[ 137 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nsame, they seem to overlap in certain important areas to such an\nextent that the unanimous agreement with which both public and\nlearned opinion have identified these two different matters seems\nwell justified. Use, indeed, does contain an element of consump-\ntion, in so far as the wearing-out process comes about through the\ncontact of the use object with the living consuming organism, and\nthe closer the contact between the body and the used thing, the\nmore plausible will an equation of the two appear. If one construes,\nfor instance, the nature of use objects in terms of wearing apparel,\nhe will be tempted to conclude that use is nothing but consumption\nat a slower pace. Against this stands what we mentioned before,\nthat destruction, though unavoidable, is incidental to use but in-\nherent in consumption. What distinguishes the most flimsy pair of\nshoes from mere consumer goods is that they do not spoil if I do\nnot wear them, that they have an independence of their own, how-\never modest, which enables them to survive even for a considerable\ntime the changing moods of their owner. Used or unused, they will\nremain in the world for a certain while unless they are wantonly\ndestroyed.\n\nA similar, much more famous and much more plausible, argu-\nment can be raised in favor of an identification of work and labor.\nThe most necessary and elementary labor of man, the tilling of the\nsoil, seems to be a perfect example of labor transforming itself into\nwork in the process, as it were. This seems so because tilling the\nsoil, its close relation to the biological cycle and its utter depend-\nence upon the larger cycle of nature notwithstanding, leaves some\nproduct behind which outlasts its own activity and forms a durable\naddition to the human artifice: the same task, performed year in\nand year out, will eventually transform the wilderness into culti-\nvated land. The example figures prominently in all ancient and\nmodern theories of laboring precisely for this reason. Yet, despite\nan undeniable similarity and although doubtless the time-honored\ndignity of agriculture arises from the fact that tilling the soil not\nonly procures means of subsistence but in this process prepares the\nearth for the building of the world, even in this case the distinction\nremains quite clear: the cultivated land is not, properly speaking, a\nuse object, which is there in its own durability and requires for its\npermanence no more than ordinary care in preservation; the tilled\n\n[ 138 ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nsoil, if it is to remain cultivated, needs to be labored upon time and\nagain. A true reification, in other words, in which the produced\nthing in its existence is secured once and for all, has never come to\npass; it needs to be reproduced again and again in order to remain\nwithin the human world at all.\n\n",
        "Section 19. REIFICATION": "\nFabrication, the work of homo faber, consists in reification. Solid-\nity, inherent in all, even the most fragile, things, comes from the\nmaterial worked upon, but this material itself is not simply given\nand there, like the fruits of field and trees which we may gather or\nleave alone without changing the household of nature. Material is\nalready a product of human hands which have removed it from its\nnatural location, either killing a life process, as in the case of the\ntree which must be destroyed in order to provide wood, or inter-\nrupting one of nature's slower processes, as in the case of iron,\nstone, or marble torn out of the womb of the earth. This element\nof violation and violence is present in all fabrication, and homo\nfaber, the creator of the human artifice, has always been a de-\nstroyer of nature. The animal laborans, which with its body and the\nhelp of tame animals nourishes life, may be the lord and master of\nall living creatures, but he still remains the servant of nature and\nthe earth; only homo faber conducts himself as lord and master of\nthe whole earth. Since his productivity was seen in the image of a\nCreator-God, so that where God creates ex nihilo, man creates out\nof given substance, human productivity was by definition bound to\nresult in a Promethean revolt because it could erect a man-made\nworld only after destroying part of God-created nature . 3\n\n3. This interpretation of human creativity is medieval, whereas the notion of\nman as lord of the earth is characteristic of the modern age. Both are in contradic-\ntion to the spirit of the Bible. According to the Old Testament, man is the master\nof all living creatures (Gen. 1), which were created to help him (2:19). But\nnowhere is he made the lord and master of the earth; on the contrary, he was put\ninto the garden of Eden to serve and preserve it (2:15). It is interesting to note\nthat Luther, consciously rejecting the scholastic compromise with Greek and\nLatin antiquity, tries to eliminate from human work and labor all elements of\nproduction and making. Human labor according to him is only “finding” the\n\n[ 139 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe experience of this violence is the most elemental experience\nof human strength and, therefore, the very opposite of the painful,\nexhausting effort experienced in sheer labor. It can provide self-\nassurance and satisfaction, and can even become a source of self-\nconfidence throughout life, all of which are quite different from the\nbliss which can attend a life spent in labor and toil or from the\nfleeting, though intense pleasure of laboring itself which comes\nabout if the effort is co-ordinated and rhythmically ordered, and\nwhich essentially is the same as the pleasure felt in other rhyth-\nmic body movements. Most descriptions of the “joys of labor,” in\nso far as they are not late reflections of the biblical contented bliss\nof life and death and do not simply mistake the pride in having done\na job with the “joy” of accomplishing it, are related to the elation\nfelt by the violent exertion of a strength with which man measures\nhimself against the overwhelming forces of the elements and which\nthrough the cunning invention of tools he knows how to multiply\nfar beyond its natural measure . 4 Solidity is not the result of\npleasure or exhaustion in earning one's bread “in the sweat of his\nbrow,” but of this strength, and it is not simply borrowed or\nplucked as a free gift from nature's own eternal presence, although\nit would be impossible without the material torn out of nature; it\nis already a product of man's hands.\n\nThe actual work of fabrication is performed under the guidance\nof a model in accordance with which the object is constructed.\nThis model can be an image beheld by the eye of the mind or a\nblueprint in which the image has already found a tentative ma-\nterialization through work. In either case, what guides the work of\nfabrication is outside the fabricator and precedes the actual work\n\ntreasures God has put into the earth. Following the Old Testament, he stresses\nthe utter dependence of man upon the earth, not his mastery: “Sage an, wer legt\ndas Silber und Gold in die Berge, dass man es findet? Wer legt in die Acker solch\ngrosses Gut als heraus wachst . . . ? Tut das Menschen Arbeit? Ja wohl, Arbeit\nfindet es wohl; aber Gott muss es dahin legen, soil es die Arbeit finden. ... So\nfinden wir denn, dass alle unsere Arbeit nichts ist denn Gottes Giiter finden und\naufheben, nichts aber moge machen und erhalten” (Werke, ed. Walch, V, 1873).\n\n4. Hendrik de Man, for instance, describes almost exclusively the satisfactions\nof making and workmanship under the misleading title: Der Kampf um die\nArbeitsfreude (1927).\n\nt no ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nprocess in much the same way as the urgencies of the life process\nwithin the laborer precede the actual labor process. (This descrip-\ntion is in flagrant contradiction to the findings of modern psychol-\nogy, which tell us almost unanimously that the images of the mind\nare as safely located in our heads as the pangs of hunger are located\nin our stomachs. This subjectivization of modern science, which is\nonly a reflection of an even more radical subjectivization of the\nmodem world, has its justification in this case in the fact that, in-\ndeed, most work in the modern world is performed in the mode of\nlabor, so that the worker, even if he wanted to, could not “labor\nfor his work rather than for himself ,” 5 and frequently is instru-\nmental in the production of objects of whose ultimate shape he has\nnot the slightest notion . 6 These circumstances, though of great his-\ntorical importance, are irrelevant in a description of the funda-\nmental articulations of the vita activa.) What claims our attention\nis the veritable gulf that separates all bodily sensations, pleasure or\npain, desires and satisfactions — which are so “private” that they\ncannot even be adequately voiced, much less represented in the\noutside world, and therefore are altogether incapable of being\nreified from mental images which lend themselves so easily and\nnaturally to reification that we neither conceive of making a bed\nwithout first having some image, some “idea” of a bed before our\ninner eye, nor can imagine a bed without having recourse to some\nvisual experience of a real thing.\n\nIt is of great importance to the role fabrication came to play\nwithin the hierarchy of the vita activa that the image or model\nwhose shape guides the fabrication process not only precedes it,\nbut does not disappear with the finished product, which it survives\nintact, present, as it were, to lend itself to an infinite continuation\nof fabrication. This potential multiplication, inherent in work, is\n\n5. Yves Simon, Trois le C ms sur le travail (Paris, n.d.) . This type of idealization\nis frequent in liberal or left-wing Catholic thought in France (see especially Jean\nLacroix, “La notion du travail,” La vie intellectuelle [June, 1952], and the Domini-\ncan M. D. Chenu, “Pour une theologie du travail,” Esprit [1952 and 1955]:\n“lx travailleur travaille pour son oeuvre piutot que pour lui-meme: loi de\ngenerosite metaphysique, qui definit l'activite laborieuse”) .\n\n6. Georges Friedmann ( Problemes humains du mackinisme industriel [1946], p.\n211) relates how frequently the workers in the great factories do not even know\nthe name or the exact function of the piece produced by their machine.\n\n[ 141 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndifferent in principle from the repetition which is the mark of\nlabor. This repetition is urged upon and remains subject to the\nbiological cycle; the needs and wants of the human body come and\ngo, and though they reappear again and again at regular intervals,\nthey never remain for any length of time. Multiplication, in dis-\ntinction from mere repetition, multiplies something that already\npossesses a relatively stable, relatively permanent existence in the\nworld. This quality of permanence in the model or image, of being\nthere before fabrication starts and remaining after it has come to\nan end, surviving all the possible use objects it continues to help\ninto existence, had a powerful influence on Plato's doctrine of\neternal ideas. In so far as his teaching was inspired by the word\nidea or etdos (“shape” or “form”), which he used for the first time\nin a philosophical context, it rested on experiences in poiesis or\nfabrication, and although Plato used his theory to express quite\ndifferent and perhaps much more “philosophical” experiences, he\nnever failed to draw his examples from the field of making when he\nwanted to demonstrate the plausibility of what he was saying . 7\n\n7. Aristotle's testimony that Plato introduced the term idea into philosophic\nterminology occurs in the first book of his Metaphysics (987b8). An excellent\naccount of the earlier usage of the word and of Plato's teaching is Gerard F.\nElse, “The Terminology of Ideas,” Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol,\nXLVII (1936). Else rightly insists that “what the doctrine of Ideas was in its\nfinal and complete form is something we cannot learn from the dialogues.” We\nare equally uncertain about the doctrine's origin, but there the safest guide may\nstill be the word itself which Plato so strikingly introduced into philosophic ter-\nminology, even though the word was not current in Attic speech. The words\neidos and idea doubtlessly relate to visible forms or shapes, especially of living\ncreatures; this makes it unlikely that Plato conceived the doctrine of ideas under\nthe influence of geometrical forms. Francis M. Cornford's thesis (Plato and\nParmenides [Liberal Arts ed.], pp. 69-100) that the doctrine is probably Socratic\nin origin, in so far as Socrates sought to define justice in itself or goodness in itself,\nwhich cannot be perceived with the senses, as well, as Pythagorean, in so far as\nthe doctrine of the ideas' eternal and separate existence ( chorismos ) from all\nperishable things involves “the separate existence of a conscious and knowing\nsoul, apart from the body and the senses,” sounds to me very convincing. But\nmy own presentation leaves all such assumptions in abeyance. It relates simply\nto the tenth book of the Republic, where Plato himself explains his doctrine by\ntaking “the common instance” of a craftsman who makes beds and tables “in\naccordance with [their] idea,” and then adds, “that is our way of speaking in this\nand similar instances.” Obviously, to Plato the very word idea was suggestive,\n\n[ m ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nI lie one eternal idea presiding over a multitude of perishable\nthings derives its plausibility in Plato's teachings from the per-\nmanence and oneness of the model according to which many and\nperishable objects can be made.\n\nThe process of making is itself entirely determined by the cate-\ngories of means and end. The fabricated thing is an end product in\nthe twofold sense that the production process comes to an end in it\n(“the process disappears in the product,” as Marx said) and that it\nis only a means to produce this end. Labor, to be sure, also pro-\nduces for the end of consumption, but since this end, the thing to be\nconsumed, lacks the worldly permanence of a piece of work, the\nend of the process is not determined by the end product but rather\nby the exhaustion of labor power, while the products themselves,\non the other hand, immediately become means again, means of\nsubsistence and reproduction of labor power. In the process of\nmaking, on the contrary, the end is beyond doubt: it has come\nwhen an entirely new thing with enough durability to remain in the\nworld as an independent entity has been added to the human arti-\nfice. As far as the thing, the end product of fabrication, is con-\ncerned, the process need not be repeated. The impulse toward repe-\nat 1011 comes from the craftsman's need to earn his means of sub-\nsistence, in which case his working coincides with his laboring; or\nit comes from a demand for multiplication in the market, in which\ncase the craftsman who wishes to meet this demand has added, as\nPlato would have said, the art of earning money to his craft. The\npoint here is that in either case the process is repeated for reasons\noutside itself and is unlike the compulsory repetition inherent in\nlaboring, where one must eat in order to labor and must labor in\norder to eat.\n\nTo have a definite beginning and a definite, predictable end is the\nmark of fabrication, which through this characteristic alone dis-\n\n\nand he wanted it to suggest “the craftsman who makes a couch or a table not by-\nlooking ... at another couch or another table, but by looking at the idea of the\ncouch” (Kurt von Fritz, The Constitution of Athens [1950], pp. 34-35). Needless\nto say, none of these explanations touches the root of the matter, that is, the\nspecifically philosophic experience underlying the concept of ideas on the one\nhand, and their most striking quality on the other — their illuminating power, their\nbeing to phmotaton or ekphanestaton. '\n\n[ M3 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntinguishes itself from all other human activities. Labor, caught in\nthe cyclical movement of the body's life process, has neither a be-\nginning nor an end. Action, though it may have a definite begin-\nning, never, as we shall see, has a predictable end. This great re-\nliability of work is reflected in that the fabrication process, unlike\naction, is not irreversible: every thing produced by human hands\ncan be destroyed by them, and no use object is so urgently needed\nin the life process that its maker cannot survive and afford its\ndestruction. Homo faber is indeed a lord and master, not only be-\ncause he is the master or has set himself up as the master of all\nnature but because he is master of himself and his doings. This is\ntrue neither of the animal laborans , which is subject to the necessity\nof its own life, nor of the man of action, who remains in depend-\nence upon his fellow men. Alone with his image of the future prod-\nuct, homo faber is free to produce, and again facing alone the work\nof his hands, he is free to destroy.\n",
        "Section 20. INSTRUMENTALITY AND Animal Laborans": "\nFrom the standpoint of homo faber, who relies entirely on the pri-\nmordial tools of his hands, man is, as Benjamin Franklin said, a\n“tool-maker.” The same instruments, which only lighten the bur-\nden and mechanize the labor of the animal laborans, are designed\nand invented by homo faber for the erection of a world of things,\nand their fitness and precision are dictated by such “objective”\naims as he may wish to invent rather than by subjective needs and\nwants. Tools and instruments are so intensely worldly objects that\nwe can classify whole civilizations using them as criteria. No-\nwhere, however, is their worldly character more manifest than\nwhen they are used in labor processes, where they are indeed the\nonly tangible things that survive both the labor and the consump-\ntion process itself. For the animal laborans , therefore, as it is subject\nto and constantly occupied with the devouring processes of life, the\ndurability and stability of the world are primarily represented in\nthe tools and instruments it uses, and in a society of laborers, tools\n\n[ 144 ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nare very likely to assume a more than mere instrumental character\nor function.\n\nThe frequent complaints we hear about the perversion of ends\nand means in modern society, about men becoming the servants of\nthe machines they themselves invented and of being “adapted” to\ntheir requirements instead of using them as instruments for human\nneeds and wants, have their roots in the factual situation of labor-\ning. In this situation, where production consists primarily in prepa-\nration for consumption, the very distinction between means and\nends, so highly characteristic of the activities of homofaber, simply\ndoes not make sense, and the instruments which homo faber in-\nvented and with which he came to the help of the labor of the\nanimal laborans therefore lose their instrumental character once\nthey are used by it. Within the life process itself, of which laboring\nremains an integral part and which it never transcends, it is idle to\nask questions that presuppose the category of means and end, such\nas whether men live and consume in order to have strength to labor\nor whether they labor in order to have the means of consumption.\n\nIf we consider this loss of the faculty to distinguish clearly be-\ntween means and ends in terms of human behavior, we can say that\nthe free disposition and use of tools for a specific end product is\nreplaced by rhythmic unification of the laboring body with its im-\nplement, the movement of laboring itself acting as the unifying\nforce. Labor but not work requires for best results a rhythmically\nordered performance and, in so far as many laborers gang together,\nneeds a rhythmic co-ordination of all individual movements . 8 In\n\n8. Karl Bucher's well-known compilation of rhythmic labor songs in 1897\n(Arbeit und Rhythmus [6th ed.; 1924]) has been followed by a voluminous litera-\nture of a more scientific nature. One of the best of these studies (Joseph Schopp,\nDas deutsche Arbeitslied [1935]) stresses that there exist only labor songs, but no\nwork songs. The songs of the craftsmen are social; they are sung after work. The\nfact is, of course, that there exists no “natural” rhythm for work. The striking re-\nsemblance between the “natural” rhythm inherent in every laboring operation\nand the rhythm of the machines is sometimes noticed, apart from the repeated\ncomplaints about the “artificial” rhythm which the machines impose upon the\nlaborer. Such complaints, characteristically, are relatively rare among the la-\nborers themselves, who, on the contrary, seem to find the same amount of\npleasure in repetitive machine work as in other repetitive labor (see, for instance,\nGeorges Friedmann, Ou va le travail humain? [2d ed.; 1953], p. 233, and Hendrik\nde Man, op. cit., p. 213) . This confirms observations which were already made in\n\n[ M ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthis motion, the tools lose their instrumental character, and the\nclear distinction between man and his implements, as well as his\nends, becomes blurred. What dominates the labor process and all\nwork processes which are performed in the mode of laboring is\nneither man's purposeful effort nor the product he may desire, but\nthe motion of the process itself and the rhythm it imposes upon the\nlaborers. Labor implements are drawn into this rhythm until body\nand tool swing in the same repetitive movement, that is, until, in\nthe use of machines, which of all implements are best suited to the\nperformance of the animal laborans, it is no longer the body's move-\nment that determines the implement's movement but the machine's\nmovement which enforces the movements of the body. The point is\nthat nothing can be mechanized more easily and less artificially\nthan the rhythm of the labor process, which in its turn corresponds\nto the equally automatic repetitive rhythm of the life process and\nits metabolism with nature. Precisely because the animal laborans\n\nthe Ford factories at the beginning of our century. Karl Biicher, who believed\nthat “rhythmic labor is highly spiritual labor” (vergeistigt ) , already stated:\n“Aufreibencl werden nur solche einformigen Arbeiten, die sich nicht rhythmisch\ngestalten lassen” (op. cit., p. 443). For though the speed of machine work\nundoubtedly is much higher and more repetitive than that of “natural” spon-\ntaneous labor, the fact of a rhythmic performance as such makes that machine\nlabor and pre-industrial labor have more in common with each other than\neither of them has with work. Hendrik de Man, for instance, is well aware\nthat “diese von Biicher . . . gepriesene Welt weniger die des . . . handwerksmas-\nsig schopferischen Gewerbes als die der einfachen, schieren . . . Arbeitsfron\n[ist] ” (op. cit., p. 244).\n\nAll these theories appear highly questionable in view of the fact that the\nworkers themselves give an altogether different reason for their preference for\nrepetitive labor. They prefer it because it is mechanical and does not demand at-\ntention, so that while performing it they can think of something else. (They can\n“geistig wegtreten,” as Berlin workers formulated it. See Thielicke and Pentzlin,\nMensch und Arbett im technischen Zeitalter: Zum Problem der Rationalisierung\n[1954], pp. 35 ff., who also report that according to an investigation of the Max\nPlanck lnstitut fiir Arbeitspsychologie, about 90 per cent of the workers prefer\nmonotonous tasks.) This explanation is all the more noteworthy, as it coincides\nwith very early Christian recommendations of the merits of manual labor, which,\nbecause it demands less attention, is less likely to interfere with contemplation\nthan other occupations and professions (see litienne Delaruelle, “Le travail dans\nles regies monastiques occidentales du 4e au 9e siecle,” Journal de psychologic\nnormale et pathologique, Vol. XLI, No. 1 [1948]).\n\n[ U6 ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\ndoes not use tools and instruments in order to build a world but in\norder to ease the labors of its own life process, it has lived literally\nin a world of machines ever since the industrial revolution and the\nemancipation of labor replaced almost all hand tools with machines\nwhich in one way or another supplanted human labor power with\nthe superior power of natural forces.\n\nThe decisive difference between tools and machines is perhaps\nbest illustrated by the apparently endless discussion of whether\nman should be “adjusted” to the machine or the machines should be\nadjusted to the “nature” of man. We mentioned in the first chapter\nthe chief reason why such a discussion must be sterile: if the hu-\nman condition consists in man's being a conditioned being for\nwhom everything, given or man-made, immediately becomes a\ncondition of his further existence, then man “adjusted” himself to\nan environment of machines the moment he designed them. They\ncertainly have become as inalienable a condition of our existence as\ntools and implements were in all previous ages . The interest of the\ndiscussion, from our point of view, therefore, lies rather in the fact\nthat this question of adjustment could arise at all. There never was\nany doubt about man's being adjusted or needing special adjust-\nment to the tools he used; one might as well have adjusted him to\nhis hands. The case of the machines is entirely different. Unlike\nthe tools of workmanship, which at every given moment in the\nwork process remain the servants of the hand, the machines de-\nmand that the laborer serve them, that he adjust me natural rhythm\nof his body to their mechanical movement. This, certainly, does\nnot imply that men as such adjust to or become the servants of\ntheir machines; but it does mean that, as long as the work at the\nmachines lasts, the mechanical process has replaced the rhythm of\nthe human body. Even the most refined tool remains a servant,\nunable to guide or to replace the hand. Even the most primitive\nmachine guides the body's labor and eventually replaces it alto-\ngether.\n\nAs is so frequently the case with historical developments, it\nseems as though the actual implications of technology, that is, of\nthe replacement of tools and implements with machinery, have\ncome to light only in its last stage, with the advent of automation.\nFor our purposes it may be useful to recall, however briefly, the\n\n[ 147 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nmain stages of modem technology's development since the begin-\nning of the modern age. The first stage, the invention of the steam\nengine, which led into the industrial revolution, was still charac-\nterized by an imitation of natural processes and the use of natural\nforces for human purposes, which did not differ in principle from\nthe old use of water and wind power. Not the principle of the\nsteam engine was new but rather the discovery and use of the coal\nmines to feed it . 9 The machine tools of this early stage reflect this\nimitation of naturally known processes; they, too, imitate and put\nto more powerful use the natural activities of the human hand.\nBut today we are told that “the greatest pitfall to avoid is the\nassumption that the design aim is reproduction of the hand move-\nments of the operator or laborer .” 10\n\nThe next stage is chiefly characterized by the use of electricity,\nand, indeed, electricity still determines the present stage of techni-\ncal development. This stage can no longer be described in terms of\na gigantic enlargement and continuation of the old arts and crafts,\nand it is only to this world that the categories of homo faber , to\nwhom every instrument is a means to achieve a prescribed end, no\nlonger apply. For here we no longer use material as nature yields it\nto us, killing natural processes or interrupting or imitating them.\nIn all these instances, we changed and denaturalized nature for our\nown worldly ends, so that the human world or artifice on one hand\nand nature on the other remained two distinctly separate entities.\nToday we have begun to “create,” as it were, that is, to unchain\nnatural processes of our own which would never have happened\nwithout us, and instead of carefully surrounding the human artifice\nwith defenses against nature's elementary forces, keeping them as\n\n9. One of the important material conditions of the industrial revolution was\nthe extinction of the forests and the discovery of coal as a substitute for wood.\nThe solution which R. H. Barrow (in his Slavery in the Roman Empire [1928])\nproposed to “the well-known puzzle in the study of the economic history of the\nancient world that industry developed up to a certain point, but stopped short of\nmaking progress which might have been expected,” is quite interesting and rather\nconvincing in this connection. He maintains that the only factor that “hindered\nthe application of machinery to industry [was] ... the absence of cheap and good\nfuel, ... no abundant supply of coal [being] close at hand” (p. 123).\n\n10. John Diebold, Automation: The Advent of the Automatic Factory (1952),\np. 67.\n\n\n[ 1* ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nfar as possible outside the man-made world, we have channeled\nthese forces, along with their elementary power, into the world\nitself. The result has been a veritable revolution in the concept of\nfabrication; manufacturing, which always had been “a series of\nseparate steps,” has become “a continuous process,” the process of\nthe conveyor belt and the assembly line . 11\n\nAutomation is the most recent stage in this development, which\nindeed “illuminates the whole history of machinism .” 12 It certainly\nwill remain the culminating point of the modern development, even\nif the atomic age and a technology based upon nuclear discoveries\nputs a rather rapid end to it. The first instruments of nuclear tech-\nnology, the various types of atom bombs, which, if released in suf-\n\n11. Ibid., p. 69.\n\n12. Friedmann, Problemes humains du machinisme industriel, p. 168. This, in\nfact, is the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from Diebold's book: The\nassembly line is the result of “the concept of manufacturing as a continuous proc-\ness,” and automation, one may add, is the result of the machinization of the as-\nsembly line. To the release of human labor power in the earlier stage of indus-\ntrialization, automation adds the release of human brain power, because “the\nmonitoring and control tasks now humanly performed will be done by machines”\n(op. cit., p. 140). The one as well as the other releases labor, and not work. The\nworker or the “self-respecting craftsman,” whose “human and psychological\nvalues” (p. 164) almost every author in the field tries desperately to save — and\nsometimes with a grain of involuntary irony, as when Diebold and others ear-\nnestly believe that repair work, which perhaps will never be entirely automatic,\ncan inspire the same contentment as fabrication and production of a new object —\ndoes not belong in this picture for the simple reason that he was eliminated from\nthe factory long before anybody knew about automation. The workers in a fac-\ntory have always been laborers, and though they may have excellent reasons for\nself-respect, it certainly cannot arise from the work they do. One can only hope\nthat they themselves will not accept the social substitutes for contentment and\nself-respect offered them by labor theorists, who by now really believe that the\ninterest in work and the satisfaction of craftsmanship can be replaced by “human\nrelations” and by the respect workers “earn from their fellow workers” (p. 164).\nAutomation, after all, should at least have the advantage of demonstrating the\nabsurdities of all “humanisms of labor”; if the verbal and historical meaning of the\nword “humanism” is at all taken into account, the very term “humanism of\nlabor” is clearly a contradiction in terms. (For an excellent criticism of the vogue\nof “human relations” see Daniel Bell, Work and Its Discontents [1956], ch. 5,\nand R. P. Genelli, “Facteur humain ou facteur social du travail,” Revue fran(aise\ndu travail, Vol. VII, Nos. 1-3 [January-March, 1952], where one also finds a\nvery determined denunciation of the “terrible illusion” of the “joy of labor.”)\n\n[ 1*9 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nficient and not even very great quantities, could destroy all organic\nlife on earth, present sufficient evidence for the enormous scale on\nwhich such a change might take place. Here it would no longer be\na question of unchaining and letting loose elementary natural proc-\nesses, but of handling on the earth and in everyday life energies and\nforces such as occur only outside the earth, in the universe; this is\nalready done, but only in the research laboratories of nuclear\nphysicists . 13 If present technology consists of channeling natural\nforces into the world of the human artifice, future technology may\nyet consist of channeling the universal forces of the cosmos around\nus into the nature of the earth. It remains to be seen whether these\nfuture techniques will transform the household of nature as we\nhave known it since the beginning of our world to the same extent\nor even more than the present technology has changed the very\nworldliness of the human artifice.\n\nThe channeling of natural forces into the human world has shat-\ntered the very purposefulness of the world, the fact that objects are\nthe ends for which tools and implements are designed. It is char-\nacteristic of all natural processes that they come into being without\nthe help of man, and those things are natural which are not “made”\nbut grow by themselves into whatever they become. (This is also\nthe authentic meaning of our word “nature,” whether we derive it\nfrom its latin root nasci, to be born, or trace it back to its Greek\norigin, physis, which comes from phyein, to grow out of, to appear\nby itself.) Unlike the products of human hands, which must be\nrealized step by step and for which the fabrication process is en-\ntirely distinct from the existence of the fabricated thing itself, the\nnatural thing's existence is not separate but is somehow identical\nwith the process through which it comes into being: the seed con-\ntains and, in a certain sense, already is the tree, and the tree stops\nbeing if the process of growth through which it came into existence\n\n13. Gunther Anders, in an interesting essay on the atom bomb (Die Anti-\nqukrtheit des Menschen [1956]), argues convincingly that the term “experiment”\nis no longer applicable to nuclear experiments involving explosions of the new\nbombs. For it was characteristic of experiments that the space where they took\nplace was strictly limited and isolated against the surrounding world. The effects\nof the bombs are so enormous that “their laboratory becomes co-extensive with\nthe globe” (p. 260) .\n\n\n[ iso }\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nstops. If we see these processes against the background of human\npurposes, which have a willed beginning and a definite end, they\nassume the character of automatism. We call automatic all courses\nof movement which are self-moving and therefore outside the\nrange of wilful and purposeful interference. In the mode of produc-\ntion ushered in by automation, the distinction between operation\nand product, as well as the product's precedence over the operation\n(which is only the means to produce the end), no longer make\nsense and have become obsolete . 14 The categories of homo faber\nand his world apply here no more than they ever could apply to\nnature and the natural universe. This is, incidentally, why modern\nadvocates of automation usually take a very determined stand\nagainst the mechanistic view of nature and against the practical\nutilitarianism of the eighteenth century, which were so eminently\ncharacteristic of the one-sided, single-minded work orientation of\nhomo faber.\n\nThe discussion of the whole problem of technology, that is, of\nthe transformation of life and world through the introduction of the\nmachine, has been strangely led astray through an all-too-exclusive\nconcentration upon the service or disservice the machines render\nto men. The assumption here is that every tool and implement is\nprimarily designed to make human life easier and human labor less\npainful. Their instrumentality is understood exclusively in this\nanthropocentric sense. But the instrumentality of tools and imple-\nments is much more closely related to the object it is designed to\nproduce, and their sheer “human value” is restricted to the use the\nanimal laborans makes of them. In other words, homo faber , the\ntoolmaker, invented tools and implements in order to erect a\nworld, not — at least, not primarily — to help the human life process.\nThe question therefore is not so much whether we are the masters\nor the slaves of our machines, but whether machines still serve the\nworld and its things, or if, on the contrary, they and the automatic\nmotion of their processes have begun to rule and even destroy\nworld and things.\n\nOne thing is certain: the continuous automatic process of manu-\nfacturing has not only done away with the “unwarranted assump-\ntion” that “human hands guided by human brains represent the\n\n14. Diebold, op. cit., pp. 59-60.\n\n\n[ m ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\noptimum efficiency ,” 15 but with the much more important assump-\ntion that the things of the world around us should depend upon\nhuman design and be built in accordance with human standards of\neither utility or beauty. In place of both utility and beauty, which\nare standards of the world, we have come to design products that\nstill fulfil certain “basic functions” but whose shape will be pri-\nmarily determined by the operation of the machine. The “basic\nfunctions” are of course the functions of the human animal's life\nprocess, since no other function is basically necessary, but the\nproduct itself— not only its variations but even the “total change to\na new product”— will depend entirely upon the capacity of the\nmachine . 16\n\nTo design objects for the operational capacity of the machine\ninstead of designing machines for the production of certain ob-\njects would indeed be the exact reversal of the means-end cate-\ngory, if this category still made any sense. But even the most gen-\neral end, the release of manpower, that was usually assigned to\nmachines, is now thought to be a secondary and obsolete aim, in-\nadequate to and limiting potential “startling increases in effi-\nciency .” 17 As matters stand today, it has become as senseless to\ndescribe this world of machines in terms of means and ends as it\nhas always been senseless to ask nature if she produced the seed to\nproduce a tree or the tree to produce the seed. By the same token\nit is quite probable that the continuous process pursuant to the\nchanneling of nature's never-ending processes into the human\nworld, though it may very well destroy the world qua world as\nhuman artifice, will as reliably and limitlessly provide the species\nman-kind with the necessities of life as nature herself did before\nmen erected their artificial home on earth and set up a barrier be-\ntween nature and themselves.\n\nFor a society of laborers, the world of machines has become a\nsubstitute for the real world, even though this pseudo world can-\nnot fulfil the most important task of the human artifice, which is to\noffer mortals a dwelling place more permanent and more stable\nthan themselves. In the continuous process of operation, this world\nof machines is even losing that independent worldly character\nwhich the tools and implements and the early machinery of the\n\n15.

The natural processes on\nwhich it feeds increasingly relate it to the biological process itself,\nso that the apparatuses we once handled freely begin to look as\nthough they were “shells belonging to the human body as the shell\nbelongs to the body of a turtle.” Seen from the vantage point of\nthis development, technology in fact no longer appears “as the\nproduct of a conscious human effort to enlarge material power, but\nrather like a biological development of mankind in which the in-\nnate structures of the human organism are transplanted in an ever-\nincreasing measure into the environment of man .” 18\n",
        "Section 21. Instrumentality and Homo Faber": "\nThe implements and tools of homo faber , from which the most fun-\ndamental experience of instrumentality arises, determine all work\nand fabrication. Here it is indeed true that the end justifies the\nmeans; it does more, it produces and organizes them. The end jus-\ntifies the violence done to nature to win the material, as the wood\njustifies killing the tree and the table justifies destroying the wood.\nBecause of the end product, tools are designed and implements in-\nvented, and the same end product organizes the work process it-\nself, decides about the needed specialists, the measure of co-opera-\ntion, the number of assistants, etc. During the work process, every-\nthing is judged in terms of suitability and usefulness for the desired\nend, and for nothing else.\n\nThe same standards of means and end apply to the product itself.\nThough it is an end with respect to the means by which it was\nproduced and is the end of the fabrication process, it never be-\ncomes, so to speak, an end in itself, at least not as long as it re-\nmains an object for use. The chair which is the end of carpentering\ncan show its usefulness only by again becoming a means, either as a\nthing whose durability permits its use as a means for comfortable\nliving or as a means of exchange. The trouble with the utility\nstandard inherent in the very activity of fabrication is that the rela-\ntionship between means and end on which it relies is very much\nlike a chain whose every end can serve again as a means in some\n\n18. Werner Heisenberg, Das Naturbild der heutigen Physik (1955), pp. 14-15.\n\n[ m ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nother context. In other words, in a strictly utilitarian world, all\nends are bound to be of short duration and to be transformed into\nmeans for some further ends . 19\n\nThis perplexity, inherent in all consistent utilitarianism, the\nphilosophy of homo faber par excellence, can be diagnosed theo-\nretically as an innate incapacity to understand the distinction be-\ntween utility and meaningfulness, which we express linguistically\nby distinguishing between “in order to” and “for the sake of.”\nThus the ideal of usefulness permeating a society of craftsmen —\nlike the ideal of comfort in a society of laborers or the ideal of\nacquisition ruling commercial societies — is actually no longer a\nmatter of utility but of meaning. It is “for the sake of” usefulness\nin general that homo faber judges and does everything in terms of\n“in order to.” The ideal of usefulness itself, like the ideals of other\nsocieties, can no longer be conceived as something needed in order\nto have something else; it simply defies questioning about its own\nuse. Obviously there is no answer to the question which Lessing\nonce put to the utilitarian philosophers of his time: “And what is\nthe use of use?” The perplexity of utilitarianism is that it gets\ncaught in the unending chain of means and ends without ever ar-\nriving at some principle which could justify the category of means\nand end, that is, of utility itself. The “in order to” has become the\ncontent of the “for the sake of”; in other words, utility established\nas meaning generates meaninglessness.\n\nWithin the category of means and end, and among the experi-\nences of instrumentality which rules over the whole world of use\nobjects and utility, there is no way to end the chain of means and\nends and prevent all ends from eventually being used again as\nmeans, except to declare that one thing or another is “an end in\nitself.” In the world of homo faber, where everything must be of\nsome use, that is, must lend itself as an instrument to achieve\nsomething else, meaning itself can appear only as an end, as an\n“end in itself” which actually is either a tautology applying to all\nends or a contradiction in terms. For an end, once it is attained,\nceases to be an end and loses its capacity to guide and justify the\n\n19. About the endlessness of the means-end chain (the “ Zweckprogressus in\ninfinitum”) and its inherent destruction of meaning, compare Nietzsche, Aph. 666\nin Witte zur Macht.\n\n\n[ 154 ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nchoice of means, to organize and produce them. It has now become\nan object among objects, that is, it has been added to the huge\narsenal of the given from which homo faber selects freely his means\nto pursue his ends. Meaning, on the contrary, must be permanent\nand lose nothing of its character, whether it is achieved or, rather,\nfound by man or fails man and is missed by him. Homo faber , in so\nfar as he is nothing but a fabricator and thinks in no terms but\nthose of means and ends which arise directly out of his work activ-\nity, is just as incapable of understanding meaning as the animal\nlaborans is incapable of understanding instrumentality. And just as\nthe implements and tools homo faber uses to erect the world be-\ncome for the animal laborans the world itself, thus the meaningful-\nness of this world, which actually is beyond the reach of homo\nfaber , becomes for him the paradoxical “end in itself.”\n\nThe only way out of the dilemma of meaninglessness in all\nstrictly utilitarian philosophy is to turn away from the objective\nworld of use things and fall back upon the subjectivity of use itself.\nOnly in a strictly anthropocentric world, where the user, that is,\nman himself, becomes the ultimate end which puts a stop to the\nunending chain of ends and means, can utility as such acquire the\ndignity of meaningfulness. Yet the tragedy is that in the moment\nhomo faber seems to have found fulfilment in terms of his own ac-\ntivity, he begins to degrade the world of things, the end and end\nproduct of his own mind and hands; if man the user is the highest\nend, “the measure of all things,” then not only nature, treated by\nhomo faber as the almost “worthless material” upon which to\nwork, but the “valuable” things themselves have become mere\nmeans, losing thereby their own intrinsic “value.”\n\nThe anthropocentric utilitarianism of homo faber has found its\ngreatest expression in the Kantian formula that no man must ever\nbecome a means to an end, that every human being is an end in\nhimself. Although we find earlier (for instance, in Locke's in-\nsistence that no man can be permitted to possess another man's\nbody or use his bodily strength) an awareness of the fateful con-\nsequences which an unhampered and unguided thinking in terms of\nmeans and ends must invariably entail in the political realm, it is\nonly in Kant that the philosophy of the earlier stages of the modern\nage frees itself entirely of the common sense platitudes which we\n\nr in ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nalways find where homo faber rules the standards of society. The\nreason is, of course, that Kant did not mean to formulate or con-\nceptualize the tenets of the utilitarianism of his time, but on the\ncontrary wanted first of all to relegate the means-end category to\nits proper place and prevent its use in the field of political action.\nHis formula, however, can no more deny its origin in utilitarian\nthinking than his other famous and also inherently paradoxical in-\nterpretation of man's attitude toward the only objects that are not\n“for use,” namely works of art, in which he said we take “pleasure\nwithout any interest .” 20 For the same operation which establishes\nman as the “supreme end” permits him “if he can [to] subject the\nwhole of nature to it ,” 21 that is, to degrade nature and the world\ninto mere means, robbing both of their independent dignity. Not\neven Kant could solve the perplexity or enlighten the blindness of\nhomo faber with respect to the problem of meaning without turning\nto the paradoxical “end in itself,” and this perplexity lies in the\nfact that while only fabrication with its instrumentality is capable\nof building a world, this same world becomes as worthless as the\nemployed material, a mere means for further ends, if the standards\nwhich governed its coming into being are permitted to rule it after\nits establishment.\n\nMan, in so far as he is homo faber, instrumentalizes, and his in-\nstrumentalization implies a degradation of all things into means,\ntheir loss of intrinsic and independent value, so that eventually not\nonly the objects of fabrication but also “the earth in general and\nall forces of nature,” which clearly came into being without the\nhelp of man and have an existence independent of the human world,\nlose their “value because [they] do not present the reification\nwhich comes from work .” 22 It was for no other reason than this\nattitude of homo faber to the world that the Greeks in their classical\nperiod declared the whole field of the arts and crafts, where men\nwork with instruments and do something not for its own sake but\n\n20. Kant's term is “ein Wohlgefallen ohne alles Interesse” ( Kritik der Urteils -\nkraft [Cassirer ed.], V, 272).\n\n21. Ibid., p. 515.\n\n22. “Der Wasserfall, wie die Erde uberhaupt, wie alle Naturkraft hat keinen\nWert, weil er keine in ihm vergegenstandlichte Arbeit darstellt” ( Das Kapital ,\nIII [ Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe, Abt. II, Zurich, 1933], 698).\n\n[ U6 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nin order to produce something else, to be banausic , a term perhaps\nbest translated by “philistine,” implying vulgarity of thinking\nand acting in terms of expediency. The vehemence of this contempt\nwill never cease to startle us if we realize that the great masters of\nGreek sculpture and architecture were by no means excepted from\nthe verdict.\n\nThe issue at stake is, of course, not instrumentality, the use of\nmeans to achieve an end, as such, but rather the generalization of\nthe fabrication experience in which usefulness and utility are estab-\nlished as the ultimate standards for life and the world of men. This\ngeneralization is inherent in the activity of homo faber because the\nexperience of means and end, as it is present in fabrication, does\nnot disappear with the finished product but is extended to its\nultimate destination, which is to serve as a use object. The instru-\nmentalization of the whole world and the earth, this limitless de-\nvaluation of everything given, this process of growing meaning-\nlessness where every end is transformed into a means and which\ncan be stopped only by making man himself the lord and master of\nall things, does not directly arise out of the fabrication process; for\nfrom the viewpoint of fabrication the finished product is as much\nan end in itself, an independent durable entity with an existence of\nits own, as man is an end in himself in Kant s political philosophy.\nOnly in so far as fabrication chiefly fabricates use objects does the\nfinished product again become a means, and only in so far as the\nlife process takes hold of things and uses them for its purposes does\nthe productive and limited instrumentality of fabrication change\ninto the limitless instrumentalization of everything that exists.\n\nIt is quite obvious that the Greeks dreaded this devaluation of\nworld and nature with its inherent anthropocentrism— the “ab-\nsurd” opinion that man is the highest being and that everything\nelse is subject to the exigencies of human life (Aristotle) -no less\nthan they despised the sheer vulgarity of all consistent utilitarian-\nism. To what extent they were aware of the consequences of seeing\nin homo faber the highest human possibility is perhaps best illus-\ntrated by Plato's famous argument against Protagoras and his ap-\nparently self-evident statement that “man is the measure of all use\nthings ( chremata ) , of the existence of those that are, and of the non-\n\n[ 1S7 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nexistence of those that are not .” 23 (Protagoras evidently did not\nsay: “Man is the measure of all things,” as tradition and the stand-\nard translations have made him say.) The point of the matter is\nthat Plato saw immediately that if one makes man the measure of\nall things for use, it is man the user and instrumentalizer, and not\nman the speaker and doer or man the thinker, to whom the world\nis being related. And since it is in the nature of man the user and\ninstrumentalizer to look upon everything as means to an end—\nupon every tree as potential wood— this must eventually mean\nthat man becomes the measure not only of things whose existence\ndepends upon him but of literally everything there is.\n\nIn this Platonic interpretation, Protagoras in fact sounds like the\nearliest forerunner of Kant, for if man is the measure of all things,\nthen man is the only thing outside the means-end relationship, the\nonly end in himself who can use everything else as a means. Plato\nknew quite well that the possibilities of producing use objects and\nof treating all things of nature as potential use objects are as limit-\nless as the wants and talents of human beings. If one permits the\nstandards of homo faber to rule the finished world as they must\nnecessarily rule the coming into being of this world, then homo\nfaber will eventually help himself to everything and consider every-\nthing that is as a mere means for himself. He will judge every thing\nas though it belonged to the class of chremata, of use objects, so\nthat, to follow Plato's own example, the wind will no longer be un-\nderstood in its own right as a natural force but will be considered\nexclusively in accordance with human needs for warmth or refresh-\nment— which, of course, means that the wind as something objec-\ntively given has been eliminated from human experience. It is be-\ncause of these consequences that Plato, who at the end of his life\nrecalls once more in the Laws the saying of Protagoras, replies\nwith an almost paradoxical formula: not man — who because of his\n\n23. Theaetetus 152, and Cratylus 385E. In these instances, as well as in other\nancient quotations of the famous saying, Protagoras is always quoted as follows:\npanton chrbnaton metron estin anthropos (see Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\n[4th ed.; 1922], frag. Bl). The word chremata by no means signifies “all things,”\nbut specifically things used or needed or possessed by men. The supposed\nProtagorean saying, “Man is the measure of all things,” would be rendered in\nGreek rather as anthropos metron panton , corresponding for instance to Heraclitus'\npolemos pater panton (“strife is the father of all things”).\n\n[ m ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nwants and talents wishes to use everything and therefore ends by\ndepriving all things of their intrinsic worth— but “the god is the\nmeasure [even] of mere use objects .” 24\n",
        "Section 22. THE EXCHANGE MARKET": "\nMarx— in one of many asides which testify to his eminent histori-\ncal sense— once remarked that Benjamin Franklin's definition of\nman as a toolmaker is as characteristic of “Yankeedom,” that is, of\nthe modern age, as the definition of man as a political animal was\nfor antiquity . 26 The truth of this remark lies in the fact that the\nmodern age was as intent on excluding political man, that is, man\nwho acts and speaks, from its public realm as antiquity was on ex-\ncluding homofaber. In both instances the exclusion was not a matter\nof course, as was the exclusion of laborers and the propertyless\nclasses until their emancipation in the nineteenth century. Ihe\nmodern age was of course perfectly aware that the political realm\nwas not always and need not necessarily be a mere function of\n“society,” destined to protect the productive, social side of human\nnature through governmental administration; but it regarded ev-\nerything beyond the enforcement of law and order as “idle talk”\nand “vain-glory.” The human capacity on which it based its claim\nof the natural innate productivity of society was the unquestion-\nable productivity of homo faber. Conversely, antiquity knew full\nwell types of human communities in which not the citizen of the\npolis and not the res publica as such established and determined the\ncontent of the public realm, but where the public life of the or-\ndinary man was restricted to “working for the people” at large,\nthat is, to being a demiourgos, a worker for the people as distin-\nguished from an oiketes , a household laborer and therefore a slave . 26\n\n24. Laws 716D quotes the saying of Protagoras textually, except that for the\nword “man” ( anthropos ), “the god” (ho theos) appears.\n\n25. Capital (Modem Library ed.), p. 358, n. 3.\n\n26. Early medieval history, and particularly the history of the craft guilds,\noffers a good illustration of the inherent truth in the ancient understanding of\nlaborers as household inmates, as against craftsmen, who were considered work-\ners for the people at large. For the “appearance [of the guilds] marks the second\n\n[ /w ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe hallmark of these non-political communities was that their\npublic place, the agora , was not a meeting place of citizens, but a\nmarket place where craftsmen could show and exchange their\nproducts. In Greece, moreover, it was the ever-frustrated ambi-\ntion of all tyrants to discourage the citizens from worrying about\npublic affairs, from idling their time away in unproductive ago-\nreuein and politeuesthai , and to transform the agora into an assem-\nblage of shops like the bazaars of oriental despotism. What char-\nacterized these market places, and later characterized the medieval\ncities' trade and craft districts, was that the display of goods for\nsale was accompanied by a display of their production. “Con-\nspicuous production” (if we may vary Veblen's term) is, in fact,\nno less a trait of a society of producers than “conspicuous con-\nsumption” is a characteristic of a laborers' society.\n\nUnlike the animal laborans, whose social life is worldless and\nherdlike and who therefore is incapable of building or inhabiting a\npublic, worldly realm, homo faber is fully capable of having a pub-\nlic realm of his own, even though it may not be a political realm,\nproperly speaking. His public realm is the exchange market, where\nhe can show the products of his hand and receive the esteem which\nis due him. This inclination to showmanship is closely connected\nwith and probably no less deeply rooted than the “propensity to\ntruck, barter and exchange one thing for another,” which, accord-\ning to Adam Smith, distinguishes man from animal . 27 The point\nis that homo faber, the builder of the world and the producer of\nthings, can find his proper relationship to other people only by ex-\nchanging his products with theirs, because these products them-\n\nstage in the history of industry, the transition from the family system to the\nartisan or guild system. In the former there was no class of artisans properly so\ncalled . . . because all the needs of a family or other domestic groups . . . were\nsatisfied by the labours of the members of the group itself” (W, J. Ashley, An\nIntroduction to English Economic History and Theory [1931], p. 76).\n\nIn medieval German, the word Storer is an exact equivalent to the Greek word\ndemiourgos. “Der griechische demiourgos heisst ‘Storer', er geht beim Volk arbei-\nten, er geht auf die Stor.” Stor means demos (“people”) . (See Jost Trier, “Arbeit\nund Gemeinschaft,” Studium Generale, Vol. Ill, No. 11 [November, 1950].)\n\n27. He adds rather emphatically: “Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and\ndeliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog” ( Wealth of Nations\n[Everyman's ed.], I, 12).\n\n\n[ 160 ]\n\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nselves are always produced in isolation. The privacy which the\nearly modern age demanded as the supreme right of each member\nof society was actually the guaranty of isolation, without which no\nwork can be produced. Not the onlookers and spectators on the\nmedieval market places, where the craftsman in his isolation was\nexposed to the light of the public, but only the rise of the social\nrealm, where the others are not content with beholding, judging,\nand admiring but wish to be admitted to the company of the crafts-\nman and to participate as equals in the work process, threatened\nthe “splendid isolation” of the worker and eventually undermined\nthe very notions of competence and excellence. This isolation from\nothers is the necessary life condition for every mastership which\nconsists in being alone with the “idea,” the mental image of the\nthing to be. This mastership, unlike political forms of domination,\nis primarily a mastery of things and material and not of people.\nThe latter, in fact, is quite secondary to the activity of craftsman-\nship, and the words “worker” and “master ”— ouvrier and maitre—\nwere originally used synonymously. 28\n\nThe only company that grows out of workmanship directly is in\nthe need of the master for assistants or in his wish to educate others\nin his craft. But the distinction between his skill and the unskilled\nhelp is temporary, like the distinction between adults and children.\nThere can be hardly anything more alien or even more destructive\nto workmanship than teamwork, which actually is only a variety\nof the division of labor and presupposes the “breakdown of opera-\ntions into their simple constituent motions.” 29 1 he team, the multi-\n\n28.

Levasseur, Histoire des classes ouvrieres et de I'industrie en France avant\n1789 (1900) : “Les mots maitre et ouvrier etaient encore pris comme synonymes\nau 14e siecle” (p. 564, n. 2), whereas “au 15e siecle ... la maitrise est devenue\nun titre auquel il n'est permis k tous d'aspirer” (p. 572). Originally, “le mot\nouvrier s'appliquait d'ordinaire k quiconque ouvrait, faisait ouvrage, maitre ou\nvalet” (p. 309) . In the workshops themselves and outside them in social life,\nthere was no great distinction between the master or the owner of the shop and\nthe workers (p. 313). (See also Pierre Brizon, Histoire du travail et des travailleurs\n[4th ed.; 1926], pp. 39 ff.)\n\n29. Charles R. Walker and Robert H. Guest, The Man on the Assembly Line\n(1952), p. 10. Adam Smith's famous description of this principle in pin-making\n(op. cit., I, 4 ff.) shows clearly how machine work was preceded by the division\nof labor and derives its principle from it.\n\n[ 161 }\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nheaded subject of all production carried out according to the prin-\nciple of division of labor, possesses the same togetherness as the\nparts which form the whole, and each attempt of isolation on the\npart of the members of the team would be fatal to the production\nitself. But it is not only this togetherness which the master and\nworkman lacks while actively engaged in production; the spe-\ncifically political forms of being together with others, acting in\nconcert and speaking with each other, are completely outside the\nrange of his productivity. Only when he stops working and his\nproduct is finished can he abandon his isolation.\n\nHistorically, the last public realm, the last meeting place which\nis at least connected with the activity of homo faber, is the ex-\nchange market on which his products are displayed. The commer-\ncial society, characteristic of the earlier stages of the modern age\nor the beginnings of manufacturing capitalism, sprang from this\n“conspicuous production” with its concomitant hunger for uni-\nversal possibilities of truck and barter, and its end came with the\nrise of labor and the labor society which replaced conspicuous pro-\nduction and its pride with “conspicuous consumption” and its\nconcomitant vanity.\n\nThe people who met on the exchange market, to be sure, were\nno longer the fabricators themselves, and they did not meet as\npersons but as owners of commodities and exchange values, as\nMarx abundantly pointed out. In a society where exchange of\nproducts has become the chief public activity, even the laborers,\nbecause they are confronted with “money or commodity owners,”\nbecome proprietors, “owners of their labor power.” It is only at\nthis point that Marx's famous self-alienation, the degradation of\nmen into commodities, sets in, and this degradation is characteristic\nof labor's situation in a manufacturing society which judges men\nnot as persons but as producers, according to the quality of their\nproducts. A laboring society, on the contrary, judges men accord-\ning to the functions they perform in the labor process; while labor\npower in the eyes of homo faber is only the means to produce the\nnecessarily higher end, that is, either a use object or an object for\nexchange, laboring society bestows upon labor power the same\nhigher value it reserves for the machine. In other words, this so-\nciety is only seemingly more “humane,” although it is true that\n\n[ 162 ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nunder its conditions the price of human labor rises to such an extent\nthat it may seem to be more valued and more valuable than any\ngiven material or matter; in fact, it only foreshadows something\neven more “valuable,” namely, the smoother functioning of the\nmachine whose tremendous power of processing first standardizes\nand then devaluates all things into consumer goods.\n\nCommercial society, or capitalism in its earlier stages when it\nwas still possessed by a fiercely competitive and acquisitive spirit,\nis still ruled by the standards of homo faber. When homo faber\ncomes out of his isolation, he appears as a merchant and trader and\nestablishes the exchange market in this capacity. This market\nmust exist prior to the rise of a manufacturing class, which then\nproduces exclusively for the market, that is, produces exchange\nobjects rather than use things. In this process from isolated crafts-\nmanship to manufacturing for the exchange market, the finished\nend product changes its quality somewhat but not altogether. Dura-\nbility, which alone determines if a thing can exist as a thing and\nendure in the world as a distinct entity, remains the supreme cri-\nterion, although it no longer makes a thing fit for use but rather fit\nto “be stored up beforehand” for future exchange . 30\n\nThis is the change in quality reflected in the current distinction\nbetween use and exchange value, whereby the latter is related to\nthe former as the merchant and trader is related to the fabricator\nand manufacturer. In so far as homo faber fabricates use objects, he\nnot only produces them in the privacy of isolation but also for the\nprivacy of usage, from which they emerge and appear in the public\nrealm when they become commodities in the exchange market. It\nhas frequently been remarked and unfortunately as frequently been\nforgotten that value, being “an idea of proportion between the pos-\nsession of one thing and the possession of another in the conception\nof man ,” 31 “always means value in exchange .” 32 For it is only in\nthe exchange market, where everything can be exchanged for\nsomething else, that all things, whether they are products of labor\n\n30. Adam Smith, op. cit., II, 241.\n\n3 1 . This definition was given by the Italian economist Abbey Galiani. I quote\nfrom Hannah R. Sewall, The Theory of Value before Adam Smith (1901) (“Publi-\ncations of the American Economic Association,” 3d Ser., Vol. II, No. 3), p. 92.\n\n32. Alfred Marshall, Principles of Economics (1920), I, 8.\n\n[ 163 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nor work, consumer goods or use objects, necessary for the life of\nthe body or the convenience of living or the life of the mind, be-\ncome “values.” This value consists solely in the esteem of the\npublic realm where the things appear as commodities, and it is\nneither labor, nor work, nor capital, nor profit, nor material,\nwhich bestows such value upon an object, but only and exclusively\nthe public realm where it appears to be esteemed, demanded, or\nneglected. Value is the quality a thing can never possess in privacy\nbut acquires automatically the moment it appears in public. This\n“marketable value,” as Locke very clearly pointed out, has noth-\ning to do with “the intrinsick natural worth of anything ” 33 which\nis an objective quality of the thing itself, “outside the will of the\nindividual purchaser or seller; something attached to the thing it-\nself, existing whether he liked it or not, and that he ought to recog-\nnize .” 34 This intrinsic worth of a thing can be changed only\nthrough the change of the thing itself— thus one ruins the worth of\na table by depriving it of one of its legs — whereas “the marketable\nvalue” of a commodity is altered by “the alteration of some propor-\ntion which that commodity bears to something else .” 35\n\nValues, in other words, in distinction from things or deeds or\nideas, are never the products of a specific human activity, but come\ninto being whenever any such products are drawn into the ever-\nchanging relativity of exchange between the members of society.\n\n3 3 . “Considerations upon the Lowering of Interest and Raising the Value of\nMoney,” Collected Works (1801), II, 21.\n\n34. W. J. Ashley (op. cit., p. 140) remarks that “the fundamental difference\nbetween the medieval and modem point of view ... is that, with us, value is\nsomething entirely subjective; it is what each individual cares to give for a thing.\nWith Aquinas it was something objective.” This is true only to an extent, for\n“the first thing upon which the medieval teachers insist is that value is not deter-\nmined by the intrinsic excellence of the thing itself, because, if it were, a fly\nwould be more valuable than a pearl as being intrinsically more excellent”\n(George O'Brien, An Essay on Medieval Economic Teaching [1920], p. 109). The\ndiscrepancy is resolved if one introduces Locke's distinction between “worth”\nand “value,” calling the former valor naturalis and the latter pretium and also\nvalor. This distinction exists, of course, in all but the most primitive societies,\nbut in the modern age the former disappears more and more in favor of the latter.\n(For medieval teaching, see also Slater, “Value in Theology and Political Econ-\nomy,” Irish Ecclesiastical Record [September, 1901].)\n\n35. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government , sec. 22.\n\n[ 164 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nNobody, as Marx rightly insisted, seen “in his isolation produces\nvalues,” and nobody, he could have added, in his isolation cares\nabout them; things or ideas or moral ideals “become values only in\ntheir social relationship .” 36\n\nThe confusion in classical economics , 37 and the worse confusion\narising from the use of the term “value” in philosophy, were\noriginally caused by the fact that the older word “worth,” which\nwe still find in Locke, was supplanted by the seemingly more sci-\nentific term, “use value.” Marx, too, accepted this terminology\nand, in line with his repugnance to the public realm, saw quite\nconsistently in the change from use value to exchange value the\noriginal sin of capitalism. But against these sins of a commercial\nsociety, where indeed the exchange market is the most important\npublic place and where therefore every thing becomes an exchange-\nable value, a commodity, Marx did not summon up the “intrinsick”\nobjective worth of the thing in itself. In its stead he put the func-\ntion things have in the consuming life process of men which knows\nneither objective and intrinsic worth nor subjective and socially\ndetermined value. In the socialist equal distribution of all goods to\nall who labor, every tangible thing dissolves into a mere function\nin the regeneration process of life and labor power.\n\nHowever, this verbal confusion tells only one part of the story.\nThe reason for Marx's stubborn retention of the term “use value,”\nas well as for the numerous futile attempts to find some objective\nsource — such as labor, or land, or profit — for the birth of values,\nwas that nobody found it easy to accept the simple fact that no\n“absolute value” exists in the exchange market, which is the proper\nsphere for values, and that to look for it resembled nothing so\nmuch as the attempt to square the circle. The much deplored de-\nvaluation of all things, that is, the loss of all intrinsic worth, begins\nwith their transformation into values or commodities, for from this\nmoment on they exist only in relation to some other thing which can\n\n36. Das Kapital, III, 689 ( Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe, Part II [Zurich, 1933]) .\n\n37. The clearest illustration of the confusion is Ricardo's theory of value\nespecially his desperate belief in an absolute value. (The interpretations in Gun-\nnar Myrdal, The Political Element in the Development of Economic Theory [19J3],\npp. 66 ff., and Walter A. Weisskopf, The Psychology of Economics [1955], ch. 3,\nare excellent.)\n\n\n[ 165 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbe acquired in their stead. Universal relativity, that a thing exists\nonly in relation to other things, and loss of intrinsic worth, that\nnothing any longer possesses an “objective” value independent of\nthe ever-changing estimations of supply and demand, are inherent\nin the very concept of value itself . 38 The reason why this develop-\nment, which seems inevitable in a commercial society, became a\ndeep source of uneasiness and eventually constituted the chief\nproblem of the new science of economics was not even relativity as\nsuch, but rather the fact that homo faber, whose whole activity is\ndetermined by the constant use of yardsticks, measurements, rules,\nand standards, could not bear the loss of “absolute” standards or\nyardsticks. For money, which obviously serves as the common\ndenominator for the variety of things so that they can be exchanged\nfor each other, by no means possesses the independent and objec-\ntive existence, transcending all uses and surviving all manipulation,\nthat the yardstick or any other measurement possesses with regard\nto the things it is supposed to measure and to the men who handle\nthem.\n\nIt is this loss of standards and universal rules, without which no\nworld could ever be erected by man, that Plato already perceived\nin the Protagorean proposal to establish man, the fabricator of\nthings, and the use he makes of them, as their supreme measure.\nThis shows how closely the relativity of the exchange market is\nconnected with the instrumentality arising out of the world of the\ncraftsman and the experience of fabrication. The former, indeed,\ndevelops without break and consistently from the latter. Plato's\nreply, however — not man, a “god is the measure of all things”\n\n38. The truth of Ashley's remark, which we quoted above (n. 34), lies in the\nfact that the Middle Ages did not know the exchange market, properly speaking.\nTo the medieval teachers the value of a thing was either determined by its worth\nor by the objective needs of men— as for instance in Buridan: valor rerum aestima-\ntur secundum humanam indigentiam — and the “just price” was normally the result\nof the common estimate, except tha t “on account of the varied and corrupt desires\nof man, it becomes expedient that the medium should be fixed according to the\njudgment of some wise men” (Gerson De contractibus i. 9, quoted from O'Brien,\nop. cit., pp. 104 ff.). In the absence of an exchange market, it was inconceivable\nthat the value of one thing should consist solely in its relationship or proportion to\nanother thing. The question, therefore, is not so much whether value is objective\nor subjective, but whether it can be absolute or indicates only the relationship\nbetween things.\n\n\n[ 166 ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\n— would be an empty, moralizing gesture if it were really true,\nas the modern age assumed, that instrumentality under the dis-\nguise of usefulness rules the realm of the finished world as ex-\nclusively as it rules the activity through which the world and all\nthings it contains came into being.\n",
        "Section 23. THE PERMANENCE OF THE WORLD AND THE WORK OF ART": "\nAmong the things that give the human artifice the stability without\nwhich it could never be a reliable home for men are a number of\nobjects which are strictly without any utility whatsoever and\nwhich, moreover, because they are unique, are not exchangeable\nand therefore defy equalization through a common denominator\nsuch as money; if they enter the exchange market, they can only be\narbitrarily priced. Moreover, the proper intercourse with a work\nof art is certainly not “using” it; on the contrary, it must be re-\nmoved carefully from the whole context of ordinary use objects to\nattain its proper place in the world. By the same token, it must be\nremoved from the exigencies and wants of daily life, with which it\nhas less contact than any other thing. Whether this uselessness of\nart objects has always pertained or whether art formerly served\nthe so-called religious needs of men as ordinary use objects serve\nmore ordinary needs does not enter the argument. Even if the his-\ntorical origin of art were of an exclusively religious or mythologi-\ncal character, the fact is that art has survived gloriously its sever-\nance from religion, magic, and myth.\n\nBecause of their outstanding permanence, works of art are the\nmost intensely worldly of all tangible things; their durability is\nalmost untouched by the corroding effect of natural processes,\nsince they are not subject to the use of living creatures, a use\nwhich, indeed, far from actualizing their own inherent purpose—\nas the purpose of a chair is actualized when it is sat upon— can only\ndestroy them. Thus, their durability is of a higher order than that\nwhich all things need in order to exist at all; it can attain perma-\nnence throughout the ages. In this permanence, the very stability\nof the human artifice, which, being inhabited and used by mortals,\n\n[ 167 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ncan never be absolute, achieves a representation of its own. No-\nwhere else does the sheer durability of the world of things appear\nin such purity and clarity, nowhere else therefore does this thing-\nworld reveal itself so spectacularly as the non-mortal home for\nmortal beings. It is as though worldly stability had become trans-\nparent in the permanence of art, so that a premonition of immortal-\nity, not the immortality of the soul or of life but of something im-\nmortal achieved by mortal hands, has become tangibly present, to\nshine and to be seen, to sound and to be heard, to speak and to be\nread.\n\nThe immediate source of the art work is the human capacity for\nthought, as man's “propensity to truck and barter” is the source of\nexchange objects, and as his ability to use is the source of use\nthings. These are capacities of man and not mere attributes of the\nhuman animal like feelings, wants, and needs, to which they are\nrelated and which often constitute their content. Such human prop-\nerties are as unrelated to the world which man creates as his home\non earth as the corresponding properties of other animal species,\nand if they were to constitute a man-made environment for the\nhuman animal, this would be a non-world, the product of emana-\ntion rather than of creation. Thought is related to feeling and\ntransforms its mute and inarticulate despondency, as exchange\ntransforms the naked greed of desire and usage trans forms the des-\nperate longing of needs — until they all are fit to enter the world\nand to be transformed into things, to become reified. In each in-\nstance, a human capacity which by its very nature is world-open\nand communicative transcends and releases into the world a pas-\nsionate intensity from its imprisonment within the self.\n\nIn the case of art works, reification is more than mere transfor-\nmation; it is transfiguration, a veritable metamorphosis in which it\nis as though the course of nature which wills that all fire burn to\nashes is reverted and even dust can burst into flames . 89 Works of\n\n39. The text refers to a poem by Rilke on art, which under the title “Magic,”\ndescribes this transfiguration. It reads as follows: “Aus unbeschreiblicher Ver-\nwandlung stammen / solche Gebilde — : Fiihl! und glaub! / Wir leidens oft: zu\nAsche werden Flammen, / doch, in der Kunst: zur Flamme wird der Staub. /\nHier ist Magie. In das Bereich des Zaubers / scheint das gemeine Wort hinaufge-\nstuft . . . / und ist doch wirklich wie der Ruf des Taubers, / der nach der unsicht-\nbaren Taube ruft” (in Aus Taschen-Biichem und Merk-Bldttem [19 JO]).\n\n[ 16 S ]\n\n\nWork\n\n\nart are thought things, but this does not prevent their being things.\nThe thought process by itself no more produces and fabricates\ntangible things, such as books, paintings, sculptures, or composi-\ntions, than usage by itself produces and fabricates houses and fur-\nniture. The reification which occurs in writing something down,\npainting an image, modeling a figure, or composing a melody is of\ncourse related to the thought which preceded it, but what actually\nmakes the thought a reality and fabricates things of thought is the\nsame workmanship which, through the primordial instrument of\nhuman hands, builds the other durable things of the human artifice.\n\nWe mentioned before that this reification and materialization,\nwithout which no thought can become a tangible thing, is always\npaid for, and that the price is life itself: it is always the “dead\nletter” in which the “living spirit” must survive, a deadness from\nwhich it can be rescued only when the dead letter comes again into\ncontact with a life willing to resurrect it, although this resurrection\nof the dead shares with all living things that it, too, will die again.\nThis dcadness, however, though somehow present in all art and\nindicating, as it were, the distance between thought's original home\nin the heart or head of man and its eventual destination in the\nworld, varies in the different arts. In music and poetry, the least\n“materialistic” of the arts because their “material” consists of\nsounds and words, reification and the workmanship it demands are\nkept to a minimum. The young poet and the musical child prodigy\ncan attain a perfection without much training and experience — a\nphenomenon hardly matched in painting, sculpture, or architecture.\n\nPoetry, whose material is language, is perhaps the most human\nand least worldly of the arts, the one in which the end product\nremains closest to the thought that inspired it. The durability of a\npoem is produced through condensation, so that it is as though\nlanguage spoken in utmost density and concentration were poetic\nin itself. Here, remembrance, Mnemosyne , the mother of the muses,\nis directly transformed into memory, and the poet's means to\nachieve the transformation is rhythm, through which the poem\nbecomes fixed in the recollection almost by itself. It is this close-\nness to living recollection that enables the poem to remain, to re-\ntain its durability, outside the printed or the written page, and\nthough the “quality” of a poem may be subject to a variety of\n\n[ 169 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nstandards, its “memorability” will inevitably determine its dura-\nbility, that is, its chance to be permanently fixed in the recollection\nof humanity. Of all things of thought, poetry is closest to thought,\nand a poem is less a thing than any other work of art; yet even a\npoem, no matter how long it existed as a living spoken word in the\nrecollection of the bard and those who listened to him, will even-\ntually be “made,” that is, written down and transformed into a\ntangible thing among things, because remembrance and the gift of\nrecollection, from which all desire for imperishability springs, need\ntangible things to remind them, lest they perish themselves . 40\n\nThought and cognition are not the same. Thought, the source\nof art works, is manifest without transformation or transfiguration\nin all great philosophy, whereas the chief manifestation of the cog-\nnitive processes, by which we acquire and store up knowledge, is\nthe sciences. Cognition always pursues a definite aim, which can be\nset by practical considerations as well as by “idle curiosity”; but\nonce this aim is reached, the cognitive process has come to an end.\nThought, on the contrary, has neither an end nor an aim outside\nitself, and it does not even produce results; not only the utilitarian\nphilosophy of homo faber but also the men of action and the lovers\nof results in the sciences have never tired of pointing out how en-\ntirely “useless” thought is — as useless, indeed, as the works of art\nit inspires. And not even to these useless products can thought lay\nclaim, for they as well as the great philosophic systems can hardly\nbe called the results of pure thinking, strictly speaking, since it is\nprecisely the thought process which the artist or writing philoso-\npher must interrupt and transform for the materializing reification\n\n40. The Idiomatic “make a poem” or fair e des vers for the activity of the poet\nalready relates to this reification. The same is true for the German dichten, which\nprobably comes from the Latin dictare: “das ausgesonnene geistig Geschaffene\nniederschreiben oder zum Niederschreiben vorsagen” (Grimm's Worterbuch) ; the\nsame would be true if the word were derived, as is now suggested by the\nEtymologisches Worterbuch (1951) of Kluge/Gotze, from tichen, an old word for\nschajfen, which is perhaps related to the Latin fingere. In this case, the poetic\nactivity which produces the poem before it is written down is also understood\nas “making.” Thus Democritus praised the divine genius of Homer, who “framed\na cosmos out of all kinds of words” — epeon kosmon etektenato pantoion (Diels,\nop. cit., B21). The same emphasis on the craftsmanship of poets is present in the\nGreek idiom for the art of poetry: tektones hymnon.\n\n[ HO ]\n\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\nof his work. The activity of thinking is as relentless and repetitive\nas life itself, and the question whether thought has any meaning at\nall constitutes the same unanswerable riddle as the question for the\nmeaning of life; its processes permeate the whole of human ex-\nistence so intimately that its beginning and end coincide with the\nbeginning and end of human life itself. Thought, therefore, al-\nthough it inspires the highest worldly productivity of homo faber,\nis by no means his prerogative; it begins to assert itself as his\nsource of inspiration only where he overreaches himself, as it\nwere, and begins to produce useless things, objects which are\nunrelated to material or intellectual wants, to man's physical needs\nno less than to his thirst for knowledge. Cognition, on the other\nhand, belongs to all, and not only to intellectual or artistic work\nprocesses; like fabrication itself, it is a process with a beginning\nand end, whose usefulness can be tested, and which, if it produces\nno results, has failed, like a carpenter's workmanship has failed\nwhen he fabricates a two-legged table. The cognitive processes in\nthe sciences are basically not different from the function of cogni-\ntion in fabrication; scientific results produced through cognition\nare added to the human artifice like all other things.\n\nBoth thought and cognition, furthermore, must be distinguished\nfrom the power of logical reasoning which is manifest in such oper-\nations as deductions from axiomatic or self-evident statements,\nsubsumption of particular occurrences under general rules, or the\ntechniques of spinning out consistent chains of conclusions. In\nthese human faculties we are actually confronted with a sort of\nbrain power which in more than one respect resembles nothing so\nmuch as the labor power the human animal develops in its metabo-\nlism with nature. The mental processes which feed on brain power\nwe usually call intelligence, and this intelligence can indeed be\nmeasured by intelligence tests as bodily strength can be measured\nby other devices. Their laws, the laws of logic, can be discovered\nlike other laws of nature because they are ultimately rooted in the\nstructure of the human brain, and they possess, for the normally\nhealthy individual, the same force of compulsion as the driving\nnecessity which regulates the other functions of our bodies. It is in\nthe structure of the human brain to be compelled to admit that two\nand two equal four. If it were true that man is an animal rationale in\n\n[ 171 1\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe sense in which the modern age understood the term, namely, an\nanimal species which differs from other animals in that it is en-\ndowed with superior brain power, then the newly invented elec-\ntronic machines, which, sometimes to the dismay and sometimes to\nthe confusion of their inventors, are so spectacularly more “intelli-\ngent” than human beings, would indeed be homunculi. As it is, they\nare, like all machines, mere substitutes and artificial improvers of\nhuman labor power, following the time-honored device of all divi-\nsion of labor to break down every operation into its simplest con-\nstituent motions, substituting, for instance, repeated addition for\nmultiplication. The superior power of the machine is manifest in its\nspeed, which is far greater than that of human brain power; be-\ncause of this superior speed, the machine can dispense with multi-\nplication, which is the pre-electronic technical device to speed up\naddition. All that the giant computers prove is that the modern age\nwas wrong to believe with Hobbes that rationality, in the sense of\n“reckoning with consequences,” is the highest and most human of\nman's capacities, and that the life and labor philosophers, Marx or\nBergson or Nietzsche, were right to see in this type of intelligence,\nwhich they mistook for reason, a mere function of the life process\nitself, or, as Hume put it, a mere “slave of the passions.” Ob-\nviously, this brain power and the compelling logical processes it\ngenerates are not capable of erecting a world, are as worldless as\nthe compulsory processes of life, labor, and consumption.\n\nOne of the striking discrepancies in classical economics is that\nthe same theorists who prided themselves on the consistency of\ntheir utilitarian outlook frequently took a very dim view of sheer\nutility. As a rule, they were well aware that the specific productiv-\nity of work lies less in its usefulness than in its capacity for produc-\ning durability. By this discrepancy, they tacitly admit the lack of\nrealism in their own utilitarian philosophy. For although the dura-\nbility of ordinary things is but a feeble reflection of the permanence\nof which the most worldly of all things, works of art, are capable,\nsomething of this quality — which to Plato was divine because it\napproaches immortality— is inherent in every thing as a thing, and\nit is precisely this quality or the lack of it that shines forth in its\nshape and makes it beautiful or ugly. To be sure, an ordinary use\nobject is not and should not be intended to be beautiful; yet what-\n\n[ 172 ]\n\n\n\nWork\n\n\never has a shape at all and is seen cannot help being either beautiful,\nugly, or something in-between. Everything that is, must appear,\nand nothing can appear without a shape of its own; hence there\nis in fact no thing that does not in some way transcend its func-\ntional use, and its transcendence, its beauty or ugliness, is iden-\ntical with appearing publicly and being seen. By the same token,\nnamely, in its sheer worldly existence, every thing also tran-\nscends the sphere of pure instrumentality once it is completed.\n\n1 he standard by which a thing's excellence is judged is never mere\nusefulness, as though an ugly table will fulfil the same function as a\nhandsome one, but its adequacy or inadequacy to what it should\nlook like, and this is, in Platonic language, nothing but its adequacy\nor inadequacy to the eidos or idea, the mental image, or rather the\nimage seen by the inner eye, that preceded its coming into the\nworld and survives its potential destruction. In other words, even\nuse objects are judged not only according to the subjective needs of\nmen but by the objective standards of the world where they will\nfind their place, to last, to be seen, and to be used.\n\nThe man-made world of things, the human artifice erected by\nhomo faber, becomes a home for mortal men, whose stability will\nendure and outlast the ever-changing movement of their lives and\nactions, only insomuch as it transcends both the sheer functional-\nism of things produced for consumption and the sheer utility of\nobjects produced for use. Life in its non-biological sense, the span\nof time each man has between birth and death, manifests itself in\naction and speech, both of which share with life its essential futil-\nity. The “doing of great deeds and the speaking of great words”\nwill leave no trace, no product that might endure after the moment\nof action and the spoken word has passed. If the animal laborans\nneeds the help of homo faber to ease his labor and remove his pain,\nand if mortals need his help to erect a home on earth, acting and\nspeaking men need the help of homo faber in his highest capacity,\nthat is, the help of the artist, of poets and historiographers, of\nmonument-builders or writers, because without them the only\nproduct of their activity, the story they enact and tell, would not\nsurvive at all. In order to be what the world is always meant to be,\na home for men during their life on earth, the human artifice must\nbe a place fit for action and speech, for activities not only entirely\n\n[ 173 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nuseless for the necessities of life but of an entirely different nature\nfrom the manifold activities of fabrication by which the world it-\nself and all things in it are produced. We need not choose here be-\ntween Plato and Protagoras, or decide whether man or a god\nshould be the measure of all things; what is certain is that the\nmeasure can be neither the driving necessity of biological life and\nlabor nor the utilitarian instrumentalism of fabrication and usage.\n\n\n[ 174 ]\n\n"

    "CHAPTER 5. Action": {
        "Section 24. THE DISCLOSURE OF THE AGENT IN SPEECH AND ACTION": "\nHuman plurality, the basic condition of both action and speech,\nhas the twofold character of equality and distinction. If men were\nnot equal, they could neither understand each other and those\nwho came before them nor plan for the future and foresee the\nneeds of those who will come after them. If men were not dis-\ntinct, each human being distinguished from any other who is, was,\nor will ever be, they would need neither speech nor action to\n\n[ 175 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nmake themselves understood. Signs and sounds to communicate\nimmediate, identical needs and wants would be enough.\n\nHuman distinctness is not the same as otherness-— the curious\nquality of alteritas possessed by everything that is and therefore,\nin medieval philosophy, one of the four basic, universal charac-\nteristics of Being, transcending every particular quality. Other-\nness, it is true, is an important aspect of plurality, the reason why\nall our definitions are distinctions, why we are unable to say what\nanything is without distinguishing it from something else. Other-\nness in its most abstract form is found only in the sheer multipli-\ncation of inorganic objects, whereas all organic life already shows\nvariations and distinctions, even between specimens of the same\nspecies. But only man can express this distinction and distinguish\nhimself, and only he can communicate himself and not merely\nsomething — thirst or hunger, affection or hostility or fear. In man,\notherness, which he shares with everything that is, and distinct-\nness, which he shares with everything alive, become uniqueness,\nand human plurality is the paradoxical plurality of unique beings.\n\nSpeech and action reveal this unique distinctness. Through\nthem, men distinguish themselves instead of being merely dis-\ntinct; they are the modes in which human beings appear to each\nother, not indeed as physical objects, but qua men. This appear-\nance, as distinguished from mere bodily existence, rests on\ninitiative, but it is an initiative from which no human being can\nrefrain and still be human. This is true of no other activity in the\nvita activa. Men can very well live without laboring, they can |\nforce others to labor for them, and they can very well decide\nmerely to use and enjoy the world of things without themselves\nadding a single useful object to it; the life of an exploiter or slave-\nholder and the life of a parasite may be unjust, but they certainly\nare human. A life without speech and without action, on the other\nhand — and this is the only way of life that in earnest has re-\nnounced all appearance and all vanity in the biblical sense of the\nword— is literally dead to the world; it has ceased to be a human\nlife because it is no longer lived among men.\n\nWith word and deed we insert ourselves into the human world,\nand this insertion is like a second birth, in which we confirm and\ntake upon ourselves the naked fact of our original physical ap-\n\n[ 176 1\n\n\nAction\n\n\npearance. This insertion is not forced upon us by necessity, like\nlabor, and it is not prompted by utility, like work. It may be\nstimulated by the presence of others whose company we may wish\nto join, but it is never conditioned by them; its impulse springs\nfrom the beginning which came into the world when we were\nborn and to which we respond by beginning something new on\nour own initiative . 1 To act, in its most general sense, means to\ntake an initiative, to begin (as the Greek word archein, “to begin,”\n“to lead,” and eventually “to rule,” indicates), to set something\ninto motion (which is the original meaning of the Latin agere).\nBecause they are initium , newcomers and beginners by virtue of\nbirth, men take initiative, are prompted into action. [ Initium ] ergo\nvt esset, creatus est homo, ante quem nullus fuit (“that there be a\nbeginning, man was created before whom there was nobody”),\nsaid Augustine in his political philosophy . 2 This beginning is not\nthe same as the beginning of the world ; 3 it is not the beginning of\nsomething but of somebody, who is a beginner himself. With the\ncreation of man, the principle of beginning came into the world\nitself, which, of course, is only another way of saying that the\nprinciple of freedom was created when man was created but not\nbefore.\n\nIt is in the nature of beginning that something new is started\n\n1 . This description is supported by recent findings in psychology and biology\nwhich also stress the inner affinity between speech and action, their spontaneity\nand practical purposelessness. See especially Arnold Gehlen, Der Mensch: Seine\nNatur und seine Stellung in der Welt (1955), which gives an excellent summary of\nthe results and interpretations of current scientific research and contains a wealth\nof valuable insights. That Gehlen, like the scientists upon whose results he bases\nhis own theories, believes that these specifically human capabilities are also a\n“biological necessity,” that is, necessary for a biologically weak and ill-fitted\norganism such as man, is another matter and need not concern us here.\n\n2. De civitate Dei xii. 20.\n\n3. According to Augustine, the two were so different that he used a different\nword to indicate the beginning which is man (initium), designating the beginning\nof the world by principium, which is the standard translation for the first Bible\nverse. As can be seen from De civitate Dei xi. 32, the word principium carried for\nAugustine a much less radical meaning; the beginning of the world “does not\nmean that nothing was made before (for the angels were),” whereas he adds\nexplicitly in the phrase quoted above with reference to man that nobody was\nbefore him.\n\n\n[ 177 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhich cannot be expected from whatever may have happened\nbefore. This character of startling unexpectedness is inherent in\nall beginnings and in all origins. Thus, the origin of life from\ninorganic matter is an infinite improbability of inorganic proc-\nesses, as is the coming into being of the earth viewed from the\nstandpoint of processes in the universe, or the evolution of human\nout of animal life. The new always happens against the over-\nwhelming odds of statistical laws and their probability, which for\nall practical, everyday purposes amounts to certainty; the new\ntherefore always appears in the guise of a miracle. 1 he fact that\nman is capable of action means that the unexpected can be expected\nfrom him, that he is able to perform what is infinitely improbable.\nAnd this again is possible only because each man is unique, so\nthat with each birth something uniquely new comes into the\nworld. With respect to this somebody who is unique it can be\ntruly said that nobody was there before. If action as beginning\ncorresponds to the fact of birth, if it is the actualization of the\nhuman condition of natality, then speech corresponds to the fact\nof distinctness and is the actualization of the human condition of\nplurality, that is, of living as a distinct and unique being among\nequals.\n\nAction and speech are so closely related because the primordial\nand specifically human act must at the same time contain the\nanswer to the question asked of every newcomer: “Who are\nyou?” This disclosure of who somebody is, is implicit in both his\nwords and his deeds; yet obviously the affinity between speech\nand revelation is much closer than that between action and reve-\nlation, 4 just as the affinity between action and beginning is closer\nthan that between speech and beginning, although many, and even\nmost acts, are performed in the manner of speech. Without the\naccompaniment of speech, at any rate, action would not only lose\nits revelatory character, but, and by the same token, it would lose\nits subject, as it were; not acting men but performing robots\nwould achieve what, humanly speaking, would remain incompre-\nhensible. Speechless action would no longer be action because\nthere would no longer be an actor, and the actor, the doer of\n\n4. This is the reason why Plato says that lexis (“speech”) adheres more closely\nto truth than praxis.\n\n\n[ 178 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\ndeeds, is possible only if he is at the same time the speaker of\nwords. The action he begins is humanly disclosed by the word,\nand though his deed can be perceived in its brute physical appear-\nance without verbal accompaniment, it becomes relevant only\nthrough the spoken word in which he identifies himself as the\nactor, announcing what he does, has done, and intends to do.\n\nNo other human performance requires speech to the same\nextent as action. In all other performances speech plays a subordi-\nnate role, as a means of communication or a mere accompaniment\nto something that could also be achieved in silence. It is true that\nspeech is extremely useful as a means of communication and in-\nformation, but as such it could be replaced by a sign language,\nwhich then might prove to be even more useful and expedient to\nconvey certain meanings, as in mathematics and other scientific\ndisciplines or in certain forms of teamwork. Thus, it is also true\nthat man's capacity to act, and especially to act in concert, is\nextremely useful for purposes of self-defense or of pursuit of\ninterests; but if nothing more were at stake here than to use action\nas a means to an end, it is obvious that the same end could be\nmuch more easily attained in mute violence, so that action seems\na not very efficient substitute for violence, just as speech, from\nthe viewpoint of sheer utility, seems an awkward substitute for\nsign language.\n\nIn acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively\ntheir unique personal identities and thus make their appearance in\nthe human world, while their physical identities appear without\nany activity of their own in the unique shape of the body and\nsound of the voice. This disclosure of “who” in contradistinction\nto “what” somebody is — his qualities, gifts, talents, and short-\ncomings, which he may display or hide — is implicit in everything\nsomebody says and does. It can be hidden only in complete silence\nand perfect passivity, but its disclosure can almost never be\nachieved as a wilful purpose, as though one possessed and could\ndispose of this “who” in the same manner he has and can dispose\nof his qualities. On the contrary, it is more than likely that the\n“who,” which appears so clearly and unmistakably to others,\nremains hidden from the person himself, like the daimon in Greek\nreligion which accompanies each man throughout his life, always\n\n[ 179 }\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nlooking over his shoulder from behind and thus visible only to those\nhe encounters.\n\nThis revelatory quality of speech and action comes to the fore\nwhere people are with others and neither for nor against them —\nthat is, in sheer human togetherness. Although nobody knows\nwhom he reveals when he discloses himself in deed or word, he\nmust be willing to risk the disclosure, and this neither the doer of\ngood works, who must be without self and preserve complete\nanonymity, nor the criminal, who must hide himsell: from others,\ncan take upon themselves. Both are lonely figures, the one being\nfor, the other against, all men; they, therefore, remain outside the\npale of human intercourse and are, politically, marginal figures\nwho usually enter the historical scene in times of corruption, dis-\nintegration, and political bankruptcy. Because of its inherent\ntendency to disclose the agent together with the act, action needs\nfor its full appearance the shining brightness we once called glory,\nand which is possible only in the public realm.\n\nWithout the disclosure of the agent in the act, action loses its\nspecific character and becomes one form of achievement among\nothers. It is then indeed no less a means to an end than making is\na means to produce an object. This happens whenever human\ntogetherness is lost, that is, when people are only for or against\nother people, as for instance in modern warfare, where men go\ninto action and use means of violence in order to achieve certain\nobjectives for their own side and against the enemy. In these\ninstances, which of course have always existed, speech becomes\nindeed “mere talk,” simply one more means toward the end,\nwhether it serves to deceive the enemy or to dazzle everybody\nwith propaganda; here words reveal nothing, disclosure comes\nonly from the deed itself, and this achievement, like all other\nachievements, cannot disclose the “who,” the unique and distinct\nidentity of the agent.\n\nIn these instances action has lost the quality through which it\ntranscends mere productive activity, which, from the humble\nmaking of use objects to the inspired creation of art works, has\nno more meaning than is revealed in the finished product and does\nnot intend to show more than is plainly visible at the end of the\nproduction process. Action without a name, a “who” attached to\n\n[ iso ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nit, is meaningless, whereas an art work retains its relevance\nwhether or not we know the master's name. The monuments to\nthe “Unknown Soldier” after World War I bear testimony to the\nthen still existing need for glorification, for finding a “who,” an\nidentifiable somebody whom four years of mass slaughter should\nhave revealed. The frustration of this wish and the unwillingness\nto resign oneself to the brutal fact that the agent of the war was\nactually nobody inspired the erection of the monuments to the\n“unknown,” to all those whom the war had failed to make known\nand had robbed thereby, not of their achievement, but of their\nhuman dignity . 5\n\n",
        "Section 25. THE WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS AND THE ENACTED STORIES": "\nThe manifestation of who the speaker and doer unexchangeably\nis, though it is plainly visible, retains a curious intangibility that\nconfounds all efforts toward unequivocal verbal expression. The\nmoment we want to say who somebody is, our very vocabulary\nleads us astray into saying what he is; we get entangled in a de-\nscription of qualities he necessarily shares with others like him;\nwe begin to describe a type or a “character” in the old meaning\nof the word, with the result that his specific uniqueness escapes us.\n\nThis frustration has the closest affinity with the well-known\nphilosophic impossibility to arrive at a definition of man, all defi-\nnitions being determinations or interpretations of what man is, of\nqualities, therefore, which he could possibly share with other\nliving beings, whereas his specific difference would be found in\na determination of what kind of a “who” he is. Yet apart from\nthis philosophic perplexity, the impossibility, as it were, to\nsolidify in words the living essence of the person as it shows\nitself in the flux of action and speech, has great bearing upon the\nwhole realm of human affairs, where we exist primarily as acting\nand speaking beings. It excludes in principle our ever being able\nto handle these affairs as we handle things whose nature is at our\n\n5. William Faulkner's A Fable (1954) surpasses almost all of World War I\nliterature in perceptiveness and clarity because its hero is the Unknown Soldier.\n\n[ 181 )\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndisposal because we can name them. The point is that the manifes-\ntation of the “who” comes to pass in the same manner as the no-\ntoriously unreliable manifestations of ancient oracles, which, ac-\ncording to Heraclitus, “neither reveal nor hide in words, but give\nmanifest signs .” 6 This is a basic factor in the equally notorious\nuncertainty not only of all political matters, but of all affairs that\ngo on between men directly, without the intermediary, stabilizing,\nand solidifying influence of things . 7\n\nThis is only the first of many frustrations by which action, and\nconsequently the togetherness and intercourse of men, are ridden.\nIt is perhaps the most fundamental of those we shall deal with, in\nso far as it does not rise out of comparisons with more reliable\nand productive activities, such as fabrication or contemplation or\ncognition or even labor, but indicates something that frustrates\naction in terms of its own purposes. What is at stake is the revela-\ntory character without which action and speech would lose all\nhuman relevance.\n\nAction and speech go on between men, as they are directed\ntoward them, and they retain their agent-revealing capacity even\nif their content is exclusively “objective,” concerned with the\nmatters of the world of things in which men move, which physi-\ncally lies between them and out of which arise their specific, ob-\njective, worldly interests. These interests constitute, in the word's\nmost literal significance, something which inter-est, which lies be-\ntween people and therefore can relate and bind them together.\nMost action and speech is concerned with this in-between, which\nvaries with each group of people, so that most words and deeds\nare about some worldly objective reality in addition to being a\ndisclosure of the acting and speaking agent. Since this disclosure\nof the subject is an integral part of all, even the most “objective”\nintercourse, the physical, worldy in-between along with its inter-\n\n6. Oute legei oute kryptei alia semainei (Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker [4th\ned., 1922], frag. B93).\n\n7. Socrates used the same word as Heraclitus, semainein (“to show and give\nsigns”), for the manifestation of his daimonion (Xenophon Memorabilia i. 1. 2, 4).\nIf we are to trust Xenophon, Socrates likened his daimonion to the oracles and\ninsisted that both should be used only for human affairs, where nothing is certain,\nand not for problems of the arts and crafts, where everything is predictable\n(ibid. 7-9).\n\n\n[ IS 2 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nests is overlaid and, as it were, overgrown with an altogether dif-\nferent in-between which consists of deeds and words and owes\nits origin exclusively to men's acting and speaking directly to one\nanother. This second, subjective in-between is not tangible, since\nthere are no tangible objects into which it could solidify; the\nprocess of acting and speaking can leave behind no such results\nand end products. But for all its intangibility, this in-between is\nno less real than the world of things we visibly have in common.\nWe call this reality the “web” of human relationships, indicating\nby the metaphor its somewhat intangible quality.\n\nTo be sure, this web is no less bound to the objective world of\nthings than speech is to the existence of a living body, but the rela-\ntionship is not like that of a fagade or, in Marxian terminology,\nof an essentially superfluous superstructure affixed to the useful\nstructure of the building itself. The basic error of all materialism\nin politics — and this materialism is not Marxian and not even\nmodern in origin, but as old as our history of political theory 8 —\nis to overlook the inevitability with which men disclose them-\nselves as subjects, as distinct and unique persons, even when they\nwholly concentrate upon reaching an altogether worldly, material\nobject. To dispense with this disclosure, if indeed it could ever be\ndone, would mean to transform men into something they are not;\nto deny, on the other hand, that this disclosure is real and has\nconsequences of its own is simply unrealistic.\n\nThe realm of human affairs, strictly speaking, consists of the\n\n8. Materialism in political theory is at least as old as the Platonic-Aristotelian\nassumption that political communities ( poleis ) — and not only family life or the\ncoexistence of several households (oikiai )— owe their existence to material neces-\nsity. (For Plato see Republic 369, where the polls' origin is seen in our wants and\nlack of self-sufficiency. For Aristotle, who here as elsewhere is closer to current\nGreek opinion than Plato, see Politics 1252b29: “Th e polis comes into existence\nfor the sake of living, but remains in existence for the sake of living well.”) The\nAristotelian concept of sympheron, -which we later encounter in Cicero's utilitas,\nmust be understood in this context. Both, in turn, are forerunners of the later\ninterest theory which is fully developed as early as Bodin — as kings rule over\npeoples, Interest rules over kings. In the modern development, Marx is outstand-\ning not because of his materialism, but because he is the only political thinker who\nwas consistent enough to base his theory of material interest on a demonstrably\nmaterial human activity, on laboring — that is, on the metabolism of the human\nbody with matter.\n\n\n[ m i\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nweb of human relationships which exists wherever men live to-\ngether. The disclosure of the “who” through speech, and the\nsetting of a new beginning through action, always fall into an\nalready existing web where their immediate consequences can be\nfelt. Together they start a new process which eventually emerges\nas the unique life story of the newcomer, affecting uniquely the\nlife stories of all those with whom he comes into contact. It is\nbecause of this already existing web of human relationships, with\nits innumerable, conflicting wills and intentions, that action al-\nmost never achieves its purpose; but it is also because of this\nmedium, in which action alone is real, that it “produces” stories\nwith or without intention as naturally as fabrication produces\ntangible things. These stories may then be recorded in documents\nand monuments, they may be visible in use objects or art works,\nthey may be told and retold and worked into all kinds of material.\nThey themselves, in their living reality, are of an altogether dif-\nferent nature than these reifications. They tell us more about their\nsubjects, the “hero” in the center of each story, than any product\nof human hands ever tells us about the master who produced it,\nand yet they are not products, properly speaking. Although\neverybody started his life by inserting himself into the human\nworld through action and speech, nobody is the author or producer\nof his own life story. In other words, the stories, the results of\naction and speech, reveal an agent, but this agent is not an author\nor producer. Somebody began it and is its subject in the twofold\nsense of the word, namely, its actor and sufferer, but nobody is\nits author.\n\nThat every individual life between birth and death can even-\ntually be told as a story with beginning and end is the prepolitical\nand prehistorical condition of history, the great story without\nbeginning and end. But the reason why each human life tells its\nstory and why history ultimately becomes the storybook of man-\nkind, with many actors and speakers and yet without any tangible\nauthors, is that both are the outcome of action. For the great\nunknown in history, that has baffled the philosophy of history in\nthe modern age, arises not only when one considers history as a\nwhole and finds that its subject, mankind, is an abstraction which\nnever can become an active agent; the same unknown has baffled\n\n[ 184 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\npolitical philosophy from its beginning in antiquity and contrib-\nuted to the general contempt in which philosophers since Plato\nhave held the realm of human affairs. The perplexity is that in\nany series of events that together form a story with a unique mean-\ning we can at best isolate the agent who set the whole process into\nmotion; and although this agent frequently remains the subject,\nthe “hero” of the story, we never can point unequivocally to him\nas the author of its eventual outcome.\n\nIt is for this reason that Plato thought that human affairs (ta ton\nanthropon pragmata ) , the outcome of action (praxis ) , should not be\ntreated with great seriousness; the actions of men appear like the\ngestures of puppets led by an invisible hand behind the scene, so\nthat man seems to be a kind of plaything of a god . 9 It is note-\nworthy that Plato, who had no inkling of the modern concept of\nhistory, should have been the first to invent the metaphor of an\nactor behind the scenes who, behind the backs of acting men, pulls\nthe strings and is responsible for the story. The Platonic god is\nbut a symbol for the fact that real stories, in distinction from those\nwe invent, have no author; as such, he is the true forerunner of\nProvidence, the “invisible hand,” Nature, the ‘ world spirit,\nclass interest, and the like, with which Christian and modern\nphilosophers of history tried to solve the perplexing problem that\nalthough history owes its existence to men, it is still obviously\nnot “made” by them. (Nothing in fact indicates more clearly the\npolitical nature of history— its being a story of action and deeds\nrather than of trends and forces or ideas — than the introduction of\nan invisible actor behind the scenes whom we find in all philoso-\nphies of history, which for this reason alone can be recognized as\npolitical philosophies in disguise. By the same token, the simple\nfact that Adam Smith needed an “invisible hand” to guide econom-\nic dealings on the exchange market shows plainly that more than\nsheer economic activity is involved in exchange and that eco-\nnomic man,” when he makes his appearance on the market, is an\nacting being and neither exclusively a producer nor a trader and\nbarterer.)\n\nThe invisible actor behind the scenes is an invention arising from\na mental perplexity but corresponding to no real experience.\n\n9. Laws 803 and 644.\n\n\n[ 185 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThrough it, the story resulting from action is misconstrued as a\nfictional story, where indeed an author pulls the strings and directs\nthe play. The fictional story reveals a maker just as every work\nof art clearly indicates that it was made by somebody, this does\nnot belong to the character of the story itself but only to the mode\nin which it came into existence. The distinction between a real\nand a fictional story is precisely that the latter was “made up”\nand the former not made at all. The real story in which we are\nengaged as long as we live has no visible or invisible maker be-\ncause it is not made. The only “somebody” it reveals is its hero,\nand it is the only medium in which the originally intangible mani-\nfestation of a uniquely distinct “who” can become tangible ex\npost facto through action and speech. Who somebody is or was we\ncan know only by knowing the story of which he is himself the\nhero — his biography, in other words; everything else we know\nof him, including the work he may have produced and left behind,\ntells us only what he is or was. Thus, although we know much\nless of Socrates, who did not write a single line and left no work\nbehind, than of Plato or Aristotle, we know much better and more\nintimately who he was, because we know his story, than we know\nwho Aristotle was, about whose opinions we are so much better\ninformed.\n\nThe hero the story discloses needs no heroic qualities; the word\n“hero” originally, that is, in Homer, was no more than a name\ngiven each free man who participated in the Trojan enterprise 10\nand about whom a story could be told. The connotation of cour-\nage, which we now feel to be an indispensable quality of the hero,\nis in fact already present in a willingness to act and speak at all,\nto insert one's self into the world and begin a story of one's own.\nAnd this courage is not necessarily or even primarily related to a\nwillingness to suffer the consequences; courage and even boldness\nare already present in leaving one's private hiding place and show-\ning who one is, in disclosing and exposing one's self. The extent\nof this original courage, without which action and speech and\n\n10. In Homer, the word herds has certainly a connotation of distinction, but of\nno other than every free man was capable. Nowhere does it appear in the later\nmeaning of “half-god,” which perhaps arose out of a deification of the ancient\nepic heroes.\n\n\n[ 186 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\ntherefore, according to the Greeks, freedom, would not be pos-\nsible at all, is not less great and may even be greater if the “hero”\nhappens to be a coward.\n\nThe specific content as well as the general meaning of action\nand speech may take various forms of reification in art works\nwhich glorify a deed or an accomplishment and, by transformation\nand condensation, show some extraordinary event in its full sig-\nnificance. However, the specific revelatory quality of action and\nspeech, the implicit manifestation of the agent and speaker, is so\nindissolubly tied to the living flux of acting and speaking that it can\nbe represented and “reified” only through a kind of repetition,\nthe imitation or mimesis, which according to Aristotle prevails in\nall arts but is actually appropriate only to the drama , whose very\nname (from the Greek verb dran, “to act”) indicates that play-\nacting actually is an imitation of acting . 11 But the imitative ele-\nment lies not only in the art of the actor, but, as Aristotle rightly\nclaims, in the making or writing of the play, at least to the extent\nthat the drama comes fully to life only when it is enacted in the\ntheater. Only the actors and speakers who re-enact the story's\nplot can convey the full meaning, not so much of the story itself,\nbut of the “heroes” who reveal themselves in it . 12 In terms of\nGreek tragedy, this would mean that the story's direct as well as\nits universal meaning is revealed by the chorus, which does not\nimitate 18 and whose comments are pure poetry, whereas the in-\ntangible identities of the agents in the story, since they escape all\n\n11. Aristotle already mentions that the word drama was chosen because\ndrrntes (“acting people”) are imitated ( Poetics 1448a28). From the treatise itself,\nit is obvious that Aristotle's model for “imitation” in art is taken from the drama,\nand the generalization of the concept to make it applicable to all arts seems\nrather awkward.\n\n12. Aristotle therefore usually speaks not of an imitation of action ( praxis ) but\nof the agents (prattontes ) (see Poetics 1448al ff., 1448b25, 1449b24fif.). He is\nnot consistent, however, in this use (cf. 1451a29, 1447a28). The decisive point\nis that tragedy does not deal with the qualities of men, their poiotes, but with\nwhatever happened with respect to them, with their actions and life and good or\nill fortune (1450al 5-18). The content of tragedy, therefore, is not what we\nwould call character but action or the plot.\n\n13. That the chorus “imitates less” is mentioned in the Ps. Aristotelian\nProblemata (918b28).\n\n\n[ 187 1\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ngeneralization and therefore all reification, can be conveyed only\nthrough an imitation of their acting. This is also why the theater\nis the political art par excellence; only there is the political sphere\nof human life transposed into art. By the same token, it is the\nonly art whose sole subject is man in his relationship to others.\n",
        "Section 26. THE FRAILTY OF HUMAN AFFAIRS": "\nAction, as distinguished from fabrication, is never possible in\nisolation; to be isolated is to be deprived of the capacity to act.\nAction and speech need the surrounding presence of others no less\nthan fabrication needs the surrounding presence of nature for its\nmaterial, and of a world in which to place the finished product.\nFabrication is surrounded by and in constant contact with the\nworld: action and speech are surrounded by and in constant con-\ntact with the web of the acts and words of other men. The popular\nbelief in a “strong man” who, isolated against others, owes his\nstrength to his being alone is either sheer superstition, based on\nthe delusion that we can “make” something in the realm of human\naffairs — “make” institutions or laws, for instance, as we make\ntables and chairs, or make men “better” or “worse” 14 — or it is\nconscious despair of all action, political and non-political, coupled\nwith the utopian hope that it may be possible to treat men as one\ntreats other “material .” 16 The strength the individual needs for\nevery process of production becomes altogether worthless when\naction is at stake, regardless of whether this strength is intellec-\ntual or a matter of purely material force. History is full of ex-\n\n14. Plato already reproached Pericles because he did not “make the citizen\nbetter” and because the Athenians were even worse at the end of his career than\nbefore ( Gorgias 515).\n\n15. Recent political history is full of examples indicating that the term “human\nmaterial” is no harmless metaphor, and the same is true for a whole host of mod-\nern scientific experiments in social engineering, biochemistry, brain surgery, etc.,\nall of which tend to treat and change human material like other matter. This\nmechanistic approach is typical of the modern age; antiquity, when it pursued\nsimilar aims, was inclined to think of men in terms of savage animals who need\nbe tamed and domesticated. The only possible achievement in either case is to\nkill man, not indeed necessarily as a living organism, but qua man.\n\n[ 188 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\namples of the impotence of the strong and superior man who does\nnot know how to enlist the help, the co-acting of his fellow men.\nHis failure is frequently blamed upon the fatal inferiority of the\nmany and the resentment every outstanding person inspires in\nthose who are mediocre. Yet true as such observations are bound\nto be, they do not touch the heart of the matter.\n\nIn order to illustrate what is at stake here we may remember\nthat Greek and Latin, unlike the modern languages, contain two\naltogether different and yet interrelated words with which to des-\nignate the verb “to act.” To the two Greek verbs archein (“to\nbegin,” “to lead,” finally “to rule”) and pattern (“to pass\nthrough,” “to achieve,” “to finish”) correspond the two Latin\nverbs agere (“to set into motion,” “to lead”) and genre (whose\noriginal meaning is “to bear ”). 16 Here it seems as though each\naction were divided into two parts, the beginning made by a\nsingle person and the achievement in which many join by bear-\ning” and “finishing” the enterprise, by seeing it through. Not\nonly are the words interrelated in a similar manner, the history\nof their usage is very similar too. In both cases the word that\noriginally designated only the second part of action, its achieve-\nment — pattern and gerere — became the accepted word for action\nin general, whereas the words designating the beginning of action\nbecame specialized in meaning, at least in political language.\nArchein came to mean chiefly “to rule” and “to lead” when it\nwas specifically used, and agere came to mean “to lead” rather\nthan “to set into motion.”\n\nThus the role of the beginner and leader, who was a primus\ninter pares (in the case of Homer, a king among kings) , changed\ninto that of a ruler; the original interdependence of action, the\ndependence of the beginner and leader upon others for help and\nthe dependence of his followers upon him for an occasion to act\nthemselves, split into two altogether different functions: the func-\ntion of giving commands, which became the prerogative of the\nruler, and the function of executing them, which became the duty\nof his subjects. This ruler is alone, isolated against others by his\nforce, just as the beginner was isolated through his initiative at\n\n16. For archeiti and prattein see especially their use in Homer (cf. C. Capelle,\nWbrterbuch des Homeros und der Homeriden [1889]).\n\n[ 189 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthe start, before he had found others to join him. Yet the strength\nof the beginner and leader shows itself only in his initiative and\nthe risk he takes, not in the actual achievement. In the case of\nthe successful ruler, he may claim for himself what actually is the\nachievement of many — something that Agamemnon, who was a\nking but no ruler, would never have been permitted. Through\nthis claim, the ruler monopolizes, so to speak, the strength of\nthose without whose help he would never be able to achieve\nanything. Thus, the delusion of extraordinary strength arises and\nwith it the fallacy of the strong man who is powerful because he\nis alone.\n\nBecause the actor always moves among and in relation to other\nacting beings, he is never merely a “doer” but always and at the\nsame time a sufferer. To do and to suffer are like opposite sides\nof the same coin, and the story that an act starts is composed of\nits consequent deeds and sufferings. These consequences are\nboundless, because action, though it may proceed from nowhere,\nso to speak, acts into a medium where every reaction becomes a\nchain reaction and where every process is the cause of new proc-\nesses. Since action acts upon beings who are capable of their own\nactions, reaction, apart from being a response, is always a new\naction that strikes out on its own and affects others. Thus action\nand reaction among men never move in a closed circle and can\nnever be reliably confined to two partners. This boundlessness is\ncharacteristic not of political action alone, in the narrower sense\nof the word, as though the boundlessness of human interrelated-\nness were only the result of the boundless multitude of people\ninvolved, which could be escaped by resigning oneself to action\nwithin a limited, graspable framework of circumstances; the\nsmallest act in the most limited circumstances bears the seed of\nthe same boundlessness, because one deed, and sometimes one\nword, suffices to change every constellation.\n\nAction, moreover, no matter what its specific content, always\nestablishes relationships and therefore has an inherent tendency to\nforce open all limitations and cut across all boundaries . 17 Limita-\n\n17. It is interesting to note that Montesquieu, whose concern was not with\nlaws but with the actions their spirit would inspire, defines laws as rapports sub-\n\n[ 190 }\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\ntions and boundaries exist within the realm of human affairs, but\nthey never offer a framework that can reliably withstand the on-\nslaught with which each new generation must insert itself. The\nfrailty of human institutions and laws and, generally, of all matters\npertaining to men's living together, arises from the human condi-\ntion of natality and is quite independent of the frailty of human\nnature. The fences inclosing private property and insuring the\nlimitations of each household, the territorial boundaries which pro-\ntect and make possible the physical identity of a people, and the\nlaws which protect and make possible its political existence, are\nof such great importance to the stability of human affairs precisely\nbecause no such limiting and protecting principles rise out of the\nactivities going on in the realm of human affairs itself. The limita-\ntions of the law are never entirely reliable safeguards against ac-\ntion from within the body politic, just as the boundaries of the\nterritory are never entirely reliable safeguards against action from\nwithout. The boundlessness of action is only the other side of its\ntremendous capacity for establishing relationships, that is, its\nspecific productivity; this is why the old virtue of moderation, of\nkeeping within bounds, is indeed one of the political virtues par\nexcellence, just as the political temptation par excellence is indeed\nhubris (as the Greeks, fully experienced in the potentialities of\naction, knew so well) and not the will to power, as we are inclined\nto believe.\n\nYet while the various limitations and boundaries we find in\nevery body politic may offer some protection against the inherent\nboundlessness of action, they are altogether helpless to offset its\nsecond outstanding character: its inherent unpredictability. This\nis not simply a question of inability to foretell all the logical con-\nsequences of a particular act, in which case an electronic com-\nputer would be able to foretell the future, but arises directly out\nof the story which, as the result of action, begins and establishes\n\nsisting between different beings {Esprit des lots, Book I, ch. 1; cf. Book XXVI,\nch. 1) . This definition is surprising because laws had always been defined in terms\nof boundaries and limitations. The reason for it is that Montesquieu was less\ninterested in what he called the “nature of government” — whether it was a re-\npublic or a monarchy, for instance — than in its “principle ... by which it is\nmade to act, ... the human passions which set it in motion” (Book III, ch. 1).\n\n[ m ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nitself as soon as the fleeting moment of the deed is past. The\ntrouble is that whatever the character and content of the subse-\nquent story may be, whether it is played in private or public life,\nwhether it involves many or few actors, its full meaning can reveal\nitself only when it has ended. In contradistinction to fabrication,\nwhere the light by which to judge the finished product is provided\nby the image or model perceived beforehand by the craftsman's\neye, the light that illuminates processes of action, and therefore\nall historical processes, appears only at their end, frequently when\nall the participants are dead. Action reveals itself fully only to the\nstoryteller, that is, to the backward glance of the historian, who\nindeed always knows better what it was all about than the par-\nticipants. All accounts told by the actors themselves, though they\nmay in rare cases give an entirely trustworthy statement of in-\ntentions, aims, and motives, become mere useful source material\nin the historian's hands and can never match his story in signifi-\ncance and truthfulness. What the storyteller narrates must neces-\nsarily be hidden from the actor himself, at least as long as he is\nin the act or caught in its consequences, because to him the mean-\ningfulness of his act is not in the story that follows. Even though\nstories are the inevitable results of action, it is not the actor but\nthe storyteller who perceives and “makes” the story.\n",
        "Section 27. THE GREEK SOLUTION": "\nThis unpredictability of outcome is closely related to the revela-\ntory character of action and speech, in which one discloses one's\nself without ever either knowing himself or being able to calcu-\nlate beforehand whom he reveals. The ancient saying that nobody\ncan be called eudaimm before he is dead may point to the issue at\nstake, if we could hear its original meaning after two and a half\nthousand years of hackneyed repetition; not even its Latin trans-\nlation, proverbial and trite already in Rome — nemo ante mortem\nbeatus esse diet potest — conveys this meaning, although it may have\ninspired the practice of the Catholic Church to beatify her saints\nonly after they have long been safely dead. For eudaimonia means\nneither happiness nor beatitude; it cannot be translated and per-\n\nr 192 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nhaps cannot even be explained. It has the connotation of blessed-\nness, but without any religious overtones, and it means literally\nsomething like the well-being of the daimdn who accompanies\neach man throughout life, who is his distinct identity, but appears\nand is visible only to others . 18 Unlike happiness, therefore, which\nis a passing mood, and unlike good fortune, which one may have\nat certain periods of life and lack in others, eudaimonia , like life\nitself, is a lasting state of being which is neither subject to change\nnor capable of effecting change. To be eudaimon and to have been\neudaimon, according to Aristotle, are the same, just as to “live\nwell” (eu dzen) and to have “lived well” are the same as long as\nlife lasts; they are not states or activities which change a person's\nquality, such as learning and having learned, which indicate two\naltogether different attributes of the same person at different\nmoments . 19\n\nThis unchangeable identity of the person, though disclosing\nitself intangibly in act and speech, becomes tangible only in the\nstory of the actor's and speaker's life; but as such it can be known,\nthat is, grasped as a palpable entity only after it has come to its\nend. In other words, human essence — no't human nature in gen-\neral (which does not exist) nor the sum total of qualities and\nshortcomings in the individual, but the essence of who somebody\nis — can come into being only when life departs, leaving behind\nnothing but a story. Therefore whoever consciously aims at being\n“essential,” at leaving behind a story and an identity which will\nwin “immortal fame,” must not only risk his life but expressly\nchoose, as Achilles did, a short life and premature death. Only a\nman who does not survive his one supreme act remains the indis-\nputable master of his identity and possible greatness, because he\nwithdraws into death from the possible consequences and con-\n\n18, For this interpretation of daimm and eudaimonia, see Sophocles Oedipus\nRex 1 1 86 ff., especially the verses: Tis gar, tis aner pleon / tas eudaimonias pherei / e\ntosouton hoson dokein / kai doxant' apoklinai (“For which, which man [can] bear\nmore eudaimonia than he grasps from appearance and deflects in its appearance?”) .\nIt is against this inevitable distortion that the chorus asserts its own knowledge:\nthese others see, they “have” Oedipus' daimdn before their eyes as an example;\nthe misery of the mortals is their blindness toward their own daimdn.\n\n19. Aristotle Metaphysics 1048b23 ff.\n\n[ 193 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntinuation of what he began. What gives the story of Achilles its\nparadigmatic significance is that it shows in a nutshell that eudai-\nmonia can be bought only at the price of life and that one can make\nsure of it only by foregoing the continuity of living in which we\ndisclose ourselves piecemeal, by summing up all of one's life in a\nsingle deed, so that the story of the act comes to its end together\nwith life itself. Even Achilles, it is true, remains dependent upon\nthe storyteller, poet, or historian, without whom everything he\ndid remains futile; but he is the only “hero,” and therefore the\nhero par excellence, who delivers into the narrator's hands the\nfull significance of his deed, so that it is as though he had not\nmerely enacted the story of his life but at the same time also\n“made” it.\n\nNo doubt this concept of action is highly individualistic, as we\nwould say today . 20 It stresses the urge toward self-disclosure at\nthe expense of all other factors and therefore remains relatively\nuntouched by the predicament of unpredictability. As such it be-\ncame the prototype of action for Greek antiquity and influenced,\nin the form of the so-called agonal spirit, the passionate drive to\nshow one's self in measuring up against others that underlies the\nconcept of politics prevalent in the city-states. An outstanding\nsymptom of this prevailing influence is that the Greeks, in dis-\ntinction from all later developments, did not count legislating\namong the political activities. In their opinion, the lawmaker was\nlike the builder of the city wall, someone who had to do and finish\nhis work before political activity could begin. He therefore was\ntreated like any other craftsman or architect and could be called\nfrom abroad and commissioned without having to be a citizen,\nwhereas the right to politeuesthai , to engage in the numerous ac-\ntivities which eventually went on in the polis, was entirely re-\nstricted to citizens. To them, the laws, like the wall around the\ncity, were not results of action but products of making. Before\nmen began to act, a definite space had to be secured and a struc-\nture built where all subsequent actions could take place, the space\n\n20. The fact that the Greek word for “every one” ( hekastos ) is derived from\nhekas (“far off”) seems to indicate how deep-rooted this “individualism” must\nhave been.\n\n\n[ 194 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nbeing the public realm of the polls and its structure the law; legis-\nlator and architect belonged in the same category . 21 But these\ntangible entities themselves were not the content of politics (not\nAthens, but the Athenians, were the polls 22 ), and they did not\ncommand the same loyalty we know from the Roman type of\npatriotism.\n\nThough it is true that Plato and Aristotle elevated lawmaking\nand city-building to the highest rank in political life, this does not\nindicate that they enlarged the fundamental Greek experiences of\naction and politics to comprehend what later turned out to be the\npolitical genius of Rome: legislation and foundation. The Socratic\nschool, on the contrary, turned to these activities, which to the\nGreeks were prepolitical, because they wished to turn against\npolitics and against action. To them, legislating and the execution\nof decisions by vote are the most legitimate political activities\nbecause in them men “act like craftsmen”: the result of their ac-\ntion is a tangible product, and its process has a clearly recogniz-\nable end . 23 This is no longer or, rather, not yet action (praxis),\nproperly speaking, but making (poiesis ), which they prefer be-\ncause of its greater reliability. It is as though they had said that\nif men only renounce their capacity for action, with its futility,\nboundlessness, and uncertainty of outcome, there could be a\nremedy for the frailty of human affairs.\n\nHow this remedy can destroy the very substance of human re-\nlationships is perhaps best illustrated in one of the rare instances\n\n21. See, for instance, Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics 1141b25. There is no more\nelemental difference between Greece and Rome than their respective attitudes\ntoward territory and law. In Rome, the foundation of the city and the establish-\nment of its laws remained the great and decisive act to which all later deeds and\naccomplishments had to be related in order to acquire political validity and\nlegitimation.\n\n22. See M. F. Schachermeyr, “La formation de la cite Grecque,” Diogenes,\nNo. 4 (1953), who compares the Greek usage with that of Babylon, where the\nnotion of “the Babylonians” could be expressed only by saying: the people of the\nterritory of the city of Babylon.\n\n23 . “For [the legislators] alone act like craftsmen [ cheirotechnoi ] ” because their\nact has a tangible end, an eschaton, which is the decree passed in the assembly\n( psephisma ) ( Nicomachean Ethics 1141b29).\n\n[ ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhere Aristotle draws an example of acting from the sphere of\nprivate life, in the relationship between the benefactor and his\nrecipient. With that candid absence of moralizing that is the mark\nof Greek, though not of Roman, antiquity, he states first as a\nmatter of fact that the benefactor always loves those he has\nhelped more than he is loved by them. He then goes on to explain\nthat this is only natural, since the benefactor has done a work, an\nergon, while the recipient has only endured his beneficence. The\nbenefactor, according to Aristotle, loves his “work,” the life of\nthe recipient which he has “made,” as the poet loves his poems,\nand he reminds his readers that the poet's love for his work is\nhardly less passionate than a mother's love for her children . 24 This\nexplanation shows clearly that he thinks of acting in terms of\nmaking, and of its result, the relationship between men, in terms\nof an accomplished “work” (his emphatic attempts to distinguish\nbetween action and fabrication, praxis and poiesis, notwithstand-\ning) . 26 In this instance, it is perfectly obvious how this interpre-\ntation, though it may serve to explain psychologically the phe-\nnomenon of ingratitude on the assumption that both benefactor\nand recipient agree about an interpretation of action in terms of\nmaking, actually spoils the action itself and its true result, the\nrelationship it should have established. The example of the legis-\nlator is less plausible for us only because the Greek notion of the\ntask and role of the legislator in the public realm is so utterly alien\nto our own. In any event, work, such as the activity of the legisla-\ntor in Greek understanding, can become the content of action only\non condition that further action is not desirable or possible; and\naction can result in an end product only on condition that its own\nauthentic, non-tangible, and always utterly fragile meaning is\ndestroyed.\n\nThe original, prephilosophic Greek remedy for this frailty had\nbeen the foundation of the polis. The polls, as it grew out of and\nremained rooted in the Greek pr e-polis experience and estimate of\nwhat makes it worthwhile for men to live together (syzeri),\n\n24. Ibid. 1 1 68al 3 ff.\n\n25. Ibid. 1140.\n\n[ 196 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nnamely, the “sharing of words and deeds ,” 26 had a twofold func-\ntion. First, it was intended to enable men to do permanently,\nalbeit under certain restrictions, what otherwise had been possible\nonly as an extraordinary and infrequent enterprise for which they\nhad to leave their households. The polls was supposed to multiply\nthe occasions to win “immortal fame,” that is, to multiply the\nchances for everybody to distinguish himself, to show in deed\nand word who he was in his unique distinctness. One, if not the\nchief, reason for the incredible development of gift and genius in\nAthens, as well as for the hardly less surprising swift decline of\nthe city-state, was precisely that from beginning to end its fore-\nmost aim was to make the extraordinary an ordinary occurrence\nof everyday life. The second function of the polls, again closely\nconnected with the hazards of action as experienced before its\ncoming into being, was to offer a remedy for the futility of action\nand speech; for the chances that a deed deserving fame would not\nbe forgotten, that it actually would become “immortal,” were not\nvery good. Florner was not only a shining example of the poet's\npolitical function, and therefore the “educator of all Hellas”; the\nvery fact that so great an enterprise as the Trojan War could have\nbeen forgotten without a poet to immortalize it several hundred\nyears later offered only too good an example of what could happen\nto human greatness if it had nothing but poets to rely on for its\npermanence.\n\nWe are not concerned here with the historical causes for the\nrise of the Greek city-state; what the Greeks themselves thought\nof it and its raison d'etre , they have made unmistakably clear. The\npolls - — if we trust the famous words of Pericles in the Funeral\nOration — gives a guaranty that those who forced every sea and\nland to become the scene of their daring will not remain without\nwitness and will need neither Homer nor anyone else who knows\nhow to turn words to praise them; without assistance from others,\nthose who acted will be able to establish together the everlasting\nremembrance of their good and bad deeds, to inspire admiration in\nthe present and in future ages . 27 In other words, men's life to-\ngether in the form of the polls seemed to assure that the most\n\n26. Logon kaipragmaton koinonein, as Aristotle once put it (ibid. 1126bl2).\n\n27. Thucydides ii. 41.\n\n\n[ 197 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nfutile of human activities, action and speech, and the least tangible\nand most ephemeral of man-made “products,” the deeds and\nstories which are their outcome, would become imperishable. The\norganization of the polis, physically secured by the wall around\nthe city and physiognomically guaranteed by its laws — lest the\nsucceeding generations change its identity beyond recognition—\nis a kind of organized remembrance. It assures the mortal actor\nthat his passing existence and fleeting greatness will never lack\nthe reality that comes from being seen, being heard, and, gener-\nally, appearing before an audience of fellow men, who outside the\npolis could attend only the short duration of the performance and\ntherefore needed Homer and “others of his craft” in order to be\npresented to those who were not there.\n\nAccording to this self-interpretation, the political realm rises\ndirectly out of acting together, the “sharing of words and deeds.”\nThus action not only has the most intimate relationship to the public\npart of the world common to us all, but is the one activity which\nconstitutes it. It is as though the wall of the polls and the bound-\naries of the law were drawn around an already existing public\nspace which, however, without such stabilizing protection could\nnot endure, could not survive the moment of action and speech\nitself. Not historically, of course, but speaking metaphorically and\ntheoretically, it is as though the men who returned from the\nTrojan War had wished to make permanent the space of action\nwhich had arisen from their deeds and sufferings, to prevent its\nperishing with their dispersal and return to their isolated home-\nsteads.\n\nThe polis, properly speaking, is not the city-state in its physical\nlocation; it is the organization of the people as it arises out of\nacting and speaking together, and its true space lies between\npeople living together for this purpose, no matter where they\nhappen to be. “Wherever you go, you will be a polis”: these\nfamous words became not merely the watchword of Greek\ncolonization, they expressed the conviction that action and speech\ncreate a space between the participants which can find its proper\nlocation almost any time and anywhere. It is the space of appear-\nance in the widest sense of the word, namely, the space where I\nappear to others as others appear to me, where men exist not\n\n[ 198 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nmerely like other living or inanimate things but make their appear-\nance explicitly.\n\nThis space does not always exist, and although all men are\ncapable of deed and word, most of them- — like the slave, the for-\neigner, and the barbarian in antiquity, like the laborer or crafts-\nman prior to the modern age, the jobholder or businessman in our\nworld — do not live in it. No man, moreover, can live in it all the\ntime. To be deprived of it means to be deprived of reality, which,\nhumanly and politically speaking, is the same as appearance. To\nmen the reality of the world is guaranteed by the presence of others,\nby its appearing to all; “for what appears to all, this we call\nBeing ,” 28 and whatever lacks this appearance comes and passes\naway like a dream, intimately and exclusively our own but without\nreality . 29\n\n",
        "Section 28. POWER AND THE SPACE OF APPEARANCE": "\nThe space of appearance comes into being wherever men are\ntogether in the manner of speech and action, and therefore pre-\ndates and precedes all formal constitution of the public realm and\nthe various forms of government, that is, the various forms in\nwhich the public realm can be organized. Its peculiarity is that,\nunlike the spaces which are the work of our hands, it does not sur-\nvive the actuality of the movement which brought it into being,\nbut disappears not only with the dispersal of men — as in the case\nof great catastrophes when the body politic of a people is de-\nstroyed — but with the disappearance or arrest of the activities\nthemselves. Wherever people gather together, it is potentially\nthere, but only potentially, not necessarily and not forever. That\ncivilizations can rise and fall, that mighty empires and great cul-\ntures can decline and pass away without external catastrophes —\nand more often than not such external “causes” are preceded by a\n\n28. Aristotle Nicommhem Ethics 1172b36 ff.\n\n29. Heraclitus' statement that the world is one and common to those who are\nawake, but that everybody who is asleep turns away to his own (Diels, op. cit.,\nB89), says essentially the same as Aristotle's remark just quoted.\n\n[ 199 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nless visible internal decay that invites disaster — is due to this\npeculiarity of the public realm, which, because it ultimately re-\nsides on action and speech, never altogether loses its potential\ncharacter. What first undermines and then kills political com-\nmunities is loss of power and final impotence; and power cannot\nbe stored up and kept in reserve for emergencies, like the instru-\nments of violence, but exists only in its actualization. Where\npower is not actualized, it passes away, and history is full of ex-\namples that the greatest material riches cannot compensate for\nthis loss. Power is actualized only where word and deed have not\nparted company, where words are not empty and deeds not brutal,\nwhere words are not used to veil intentions but to disclose reali-\nties, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to establish\nrelations and create new realities.\n\nPower is what keeps the public realm, the potential space of\nappearance between acting and speaking men, in existence. The\nword itself, its Greek equivalent dynamis , like the Latin potentia\nwith its various modern dervatives or the German Macht (which\nderives from mogen and moglich , not from macheri), indicates its\n“potential” character. Power is always, as we would say, a power\npotential and not an unchangeable, measurable, and reliable entity\nlike force or strength. While strength is the natural quality of an\nindividual seen in isolation, power springs up between men when\nthey act together and vanishes the moment they disperse. Because\nof this peculiarity, which power shares with all potentialities that\ncan only be actualized but never fully materialized, power is to\nan astonishing degree independent of material factors, either of\nnumbers or means. A comparatively small but well-organized\ngroup of men can rule almost indefinitely over large and populous\nempires, and it is not infrequent in history that small and poor\ncountries get the better of great and rich nations. (The story of\nDavid and Goliath is only metaphorically true; the power of a\nfew can be greater than the power of many, but in a contest be-\ntween two men not power but strength decides, and cleverness,\nthat is, brain power, contributes materially to the outcome on the\nsame level as muscular force.) Popular revolt against materially\nstrong rulers, on the other hand, may engender an almost irresist-\nible power even if it foregoes the use of violence in the face of\n\n[ 200 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nmaterially vastly superior forces. To call this “passive resistance”\nis certainly an ironic idea; it is one of the most active and efficient\nways of action ever devised, because it cannot be countered by\nfighting, where there may be defeat or victory, but only by mass\nslaughter in which even the victor is defeated, cheated of his prize,\nsince nobody can rule over dead men.\n\nThe only indispensable material factor in the generation of\npower is the living together of people. Only where men live so\nclose together that the potentialities of action are always present\ncan power remain with them, and the foundation of cities, which\nas city-states have remained paradigmatic for all Western political\norganization, is therefore indeed the most important material pre-\nrequisite for power. What keeps people together after the fleeting\nmoment of action has passed (what we today call “organization”)\nand what, at the same time, they keep alive through remaining to-\ngether is power. And whoever, for whatever reasons, isolates\nhimself and does not partake in such being together, forfeits power\nand becomes impotent, no matter how great his strength and how\nvalid his reasons.\n\nIf power were more than this potentiality in being together, if\nit could be possessed like strength or applied like force instead of\nbeing dependent upon the unreliable and only temporary agree-\nment of many wills and intentions, omnipotence would be a con-\ncrete human possibility. For power, like action, is boundless; it\nhas no physical limitation in human nature, in the bodily existence\nof man, like strength. Its only limitation is the existence of other\npeople, but this limitation is not accidental, because human power\ncorresponds to the condition of plurality to begin with. For the\nsame reason, power can be divided without decreasing it, and the\ninterplay of powers with their checks and balances is even liable\nto generate more power, so long, at least, as the interplay is alive\nand has not resulted in a stalemate. Strength, on the contrary, is\nindivisible, and while it, too, is checked and balanced by the pres-\nence of others, the interplay of plurality in this case spells a defi-\nnite limitation on the strength of the individual, which is kept in\nbounds and may be overpowered by the power potential of the\nmany. An identification of the strength necessary for the produc-\ntion of things with the power necessary for action is conceivable\n\n[ 201 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nonly as the divine attribute of one god. Omnipotence therefore is\nnever an attribute of gods in polytheism, no matter how superior\nthe strength of the gods may be to the forces of men. Conversely,\naspiration toward omnipotence always implies— apart from its\nutopian hubris — the destruction of plurality.\n\nUnder the conditions of human life, the only alternative to\npower is not strength— which is helpless against power — but\nforce, which indeed one man alone can exert against his fellow\nmen and of which one or a few can possess a monopoly by acquir-\ning the means of violence. But while violence can destroy power,\nit can never become a substitute for it. From this results the by\nno means infrequent political combination of force and powerless-\nness, an array of impotent forces that spend themselves, often\nspectacularly and vehemently but in utter futility, leaving behind\nneither monuments nor stories, hardly enough memory to enter\ninto history at all. In historical experience and traditional theory,\nthis combination, even if it is not recognized as such, is known as\ntyranny, and the time-honored fear of this form of government is\nnot exclusively inspired by its cruelty, which— as the long series\nof benevolent tyrants and enlightened despots attests — is not\namong its inevitable features, but by the impotence and futility\nto which it condemns the rulers as well as the ruled.\n\nMore important is a discovery made, as far as I know, only by\nMontesquieu, the last political thinker to concern himself serious-\nly with the problem of forms of government. Montesquieu realized\nthat the outstanding characteristic of tyranny was that it rested\non isolation — on the isolation of the tyrant from his subjects and\nthe isolation of the subjects from each other through mutual fear\nand suspicion — and hence that tyranny was not one form of gov-\nernment among others but contradicted the essential human con-\ndition of plurality, the acting and speaking together, which is the\ncondition of all forms of political organization. Tyranny prevents\nthe development of power, not only in a particular segment of the\npublic realm but in its entirety; it generates, in other words, im-\npotence as naturally as other bodies politic generate power. This,\nin Montesquieu's interpretation, makes it necessary to assign it a\nspecial position in the theory of political bodies: it alone is unable\nto develop enough power to remain at all in the space of appear-\n\n[ 202 ]\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nance, the public realm; on the contrary, it develops the germs of\nits own destruction the moment it comes into existence . 30\n\nViolence, curiously enough, can destroy power more easily\nthan it can destroy strength, and while a tyranny is always char-\nacterized by the impotence of its subjects, who have lost their\nhuman capacity to act and speak together, it is not necessarily\ncharacterized by weakness and sterility; on the contrary, the\ncrafts and arts may flourish under these conditions if the ruler is\n“benevolent” enough to leave his subjects alone in their isolation.\nStrength, on the other hand, nature's gift to the individual which\ncannot be shared with others, can cope with violence more success-\nfully than with power — either heroically, by consenting to fight\nand die, or stoically, by accepting suffering and challenging all\naffliction through self-sufficiency and withdrawal from the world;\nin either case, the integrity of the individual and his strength re-\nmain intact. Strength can actually be ruined only by power and is\ntherefore always in danger from the combined force of the many.\nPower corrupts indeed when the weak band together in order to\nruin the strong, but not before. The will to power, as the modem\nage from Hobbes to Nietzsche understood it in glorification or\ndenunciation, far from being a characteristic of the strong, is, like\nenvy and greed, among the vices of the weak, and possibly even\ntheir most dangerous one.\n\nIf tyranny can be described as the always abortive attempt to\nsubstitute violence for power, ochlocracy, or mob rule, which is\nits exact counterpart, can be characterized by the much more\npromising attempt to substitute power for strength. Power indeed\ncan ruin all strength and we know that where the main public\nrealm is society, there is always the danger that, through a per-\nverted form of “acting together” — by pull and pressure and the\ntricks of cliques— those are brought to the fore who know nothing\nand can do nothing. The vehement yearning for violence, so char-\n\n30. In the words of Montesquieu, who ignores the difference between tyranny\nand despotism: “Le principe du gouvemement despotique se corrompt sans cesse,\nparcequ'il est corrompu par sa nature. Les autres gouvernements perissent,\nparceque des accidents particuliers en violent le principe: celui-ci perit par son vice\ninterieur, lorsque quelques causes accidentelles n'empechent point son principe de\nse corrompre” (op. cit., Book VIII, ch. 10).\n\n[ 203 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nacteristic of some of the best modern creative artists, thinkers,\nscholars, and craftsmen, is a natural reaction of those whom\nsociety has tried to cheat of their strength . 31\n\nPower preserves the public realm and the space of appearance,\nand as such it is also the lifeblood of the human artifice, which,\nunless it is the scene of action and speech, of the web of human\naffairs and relationships and the stories engendered by them, lacks\nits ultimate raison d'etre. Without being talked about by men and\nwithout housing them, the world would not be a human artifice\nbut a heap of unrelated things to which each isolated individual\nwas at liberty to add one more object; without the human artifice\nto house them, human affairs would be as floating, as futile and\nvain, as the wanderings of nomad tribes. The melancholy wisdom\nof Ecclesiastes — “Vanity of vanities; all is vanity. . . . There is no\nnew thing under the sun, . . . there is no remembrance of former\nthings; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are\nto come with those that shall come after”' — does not necessarily\narise from specifically religious experience; but it is certainly un-\navoidable wherever and whenever trust in the world as a place fit\nfor human appearance, for action and speech, is gone. Without\naction to bring into the play of the world the new beginning of\nwhich each man is capable by virtue of being born, “there is no\nnew thing under the sun”; without speech to materialize and\nmemorialize, however tentatively, the “new things” that appear\nand shine forth, “there is no remembrance”; without the enduring\npermanence of a human artifact, there cannot “be any remem-\nbrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.”\nAnd without power, the space of appearance brought forth through\naction and speech in public will fade away as rapidly as the living\ndeed and the living word.\n\nPerhaps nothing in our history has been so short-lived as trust\nin power, nothing more lasting than the Platonic and Christian\ndistrust of the splendor attending its space of appearance, nothing\n\n31. The extent to which Nietzsche's glorification of the will to power was\ninspired by such experiences of the modern intellectual may be surmised from the\nfollowing side remark: “Denn die Ohnmacht gegen Menschen, nicht die Ohn-\nmacht gegen die Natur, erzeugt die desperateste Verbitterung gegen das Dasein”\n(Wille zur Macht, No. 55).\n\n\n[ 204 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n— finally in the modern age— more common than the conviction\nthat “power corrupts.” The words of Pericles, as Thucydides\nreports them, are perhaps unique in their supreme confidence that\nmen can enact and save their greatness at the same time and, as it\nwere, by one and the same gesture, and that the performance as\nsuch will be enough to generate dynamis and not need the trans-\nforming reification of homo faber to keep it in reality . 32 Pericles'\nspeech, though it certainly corresponded to and articulated the\ninnermost convictions of the people of Athens, has always been\nread with the sad wisdom of hindsight by men who knew that his\nwords were spoken at the beginning of the end. Yet short-lived as\nthis faith in dynamis (and consequently in politics) may have been\n— and it had already come to an end when the first political phi-\nlosophies were formulated — its bare existence has sufficed to ele-\nvate action to the highest rank in the hierarchy of the vita activa\nand to single out speech as the decisive distinction between human\nand animal life, both of which bestowed upon politics a dignity\nwhich even today has not altogether disappeared.\n\nWhat is outstandingly clear in Pericles' formulations — and, in-\ncidentally, no less transparent in Homer's poems — is that the\ninnermost meaning of the acted deed and the spoken word is inde-\npendent of victory and defeat and must remain untouched by any\neventual outcome, by their consequences for better or worse.\nUnlike human behavior — which the Greeks, like all civilized\npeople, judged according to “moral standards,” taking into ac-\ncount motives and intentions on the one hand and aims and conse-\nquences on the other— action can be judged only by the criterion\nof greatness because it is in its nature to break through the com-\nmonly accepted and reach into the extraordinary, where whatever\nis true in common and everyday life no longer applies because\neverything that exists is unique and sui generis . 33 Thucydides, or\n\n32. In the above-mentioned paragraph in the Funeral Oration (n. 27) Pericles\ndeliberately contrasts the dynamis of th tpolis with the craftsmanship of the poets.\n\n3 3 . The reason why Aristotle in his Poetics finds that greatness ( megethos ) is a\nprerequisite of the dramatic plot is that the drama imitates acting and acting is\njudged by greatness, by its distinction from the commonplace (1450b25). The\nsame, incidentally, is true for the beautiful, which resides in greatness and taxis,\nthe joining together of the parts (1450b34 ff.) .\n\n[ 205 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nPericles, knew full well that he had broken with the normal stand-\nards for everyday behavior when he found the glory of Athens in\nhaving left behind “everywhere everlasting remembrance [mne-\nmeia aidia ] of their good and their evil deeds.” The art of politics\nteaches men how to bring forth what is great and radiant — ta\nmegala kai lampra , in the words of Democritus; as long as the polls\nis there to inspire men to dare the extraordinary, all things are\nsafe; if it perishes, everything is lost . 34 Motives and aims, no\nmatter how pure or how grandiose, are never unique; like psycho-\nlogical qualities, they are typical, characteristic of different types\nof persons. Greatness, therefore, or the specific meaning of each\ndeed, can lie only in the performance itself and neither in its\nmotivation nor its achievement.\n\nIt is this insistence on the living deed and the spoken word as\nthe greatest achievements of which human beings are capable that\nwas conceptualized in Aristotle's notion of energeia (“actuality”),\nwith which he designated all activities that do not pursue an end\n(are ateleis) and leave no work behind (no par autas erga ), but\nexhaust their full meaning in the performance itself . 35 It is from the\nexperience of this full actuality that the paradoxical “end in itself”\nderives its original meaning; for in thdse instances of action and\nspeech 36 the end (telos) is not pursued but lies in the activity itself\nwhich therefore becomes an entelecheia , and the work is not what\nfollows and extinguishes the process but is imbedded in it; the\nperformance is the work, is energeia . 87 Aristotle, in his political\nphilosophy, is still well aware of what is at stake in politics, name-\nly, no less than the ergon ton anthropou 38 (the “work of man” qua\n\n34. See fragment B157 of Democritus in Diels, op. cit.\n\n3 S. For the concept of energeia see Nicomachean Ethics 1094al-5; Physics\n201b31; On the Soul 417al6, 431a6. The examples most frequently used are\nseeing and flute-playing.\n\n36. It is of no importance in our context that Aristotle saw the highest possi-\nbility of “actuality” not in action and speech, but in contemplation and thought,\nin theoria and nous.\n\n37. The two Aristotelian concepts, energeia and entelecheia , are closely inter-\nrelated ( energeia . . . synteinei pros ten entelecheian) : full actuality ( energeia ) effects\nand produces nothing besides itself, and full reality ( entelecheia ) has no other end\nbesides itself (see Metaphysics 1050a22-35).\n\n38. Nicomachean Ethics 1097b22.\n\n[ 206 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nman), and if he defined this “work” as “to live well” (eu zeri), he\nclearly meant that “work” here is no work product but exists only\nin sheer actuality. This specifically human achievement lies alto-\ngether outside the category of means and ends; the “work of man”\nis no end because the means to achieve it — the virtues, or aretai —\nare not qualities which may or may not be actualized, but are\nthemselves “actualities.” In other words, the means to achieve the\nend would already be the end; and this “end,” conversely, cannot\nbe considered a means in some other respect, because there is\nnothing higher to attain than this actuality itself.\n\nIt is like a feeble echo of the prephilosophical Greek experience\nof action and speech as sheer actuality to read time and again in\npolitical philosophy since Democritus and Plato that politics is a\ntechne, belongs among the arts, and can be likened to such activities\nas healing or navigation, where, as in the performance of the\ndancer or play-actor, the “product” is identical with the perform-\ning act itself. But we may gauge what has happened to action and\nspeech, which are only in actuality, and therefore the highest ac-\ntivities in the political realm, when we hear what modern society,\nwith the peculiar and uncompromising consistency that charac-\nterized it in its early stages, had to say about them. For this all-\nimportant degradation of action and speech is implied when Adam\nSmith classifies all occupations which rest essentially on perform-\nance — such as the military profession, “churchmen, lawyers,\nphysicians and opera-singers” — together with “menial services,”\nthe lowest and most unproductive “labour .” 39 It was precisely\nthese occupations — healing, flute-playing, play-acting — which\nfurnished ancient thinking with examples for the highest and\ngreatest activities of man.\n\n",

Both, therefore, are, strictly speaking, unpolitical, and will\nincline to denounce action and speech as idleness, idle busybody-\nness and idle talk, and generally will judge public activities in\nterms of their usefulness to supposedly higher ends— to make the\nworld more useful and more beautiful in the case of homo faber , to\nmake life easier and longer in the case of the animal laborans. This,\nhowever, is not to say that they are free to dispense with a public\nrealm altogether, for without a space of appearance and without\ntrusting in action and speech as a mode of being together, neither\nthe reality of one's self, of one's own identity, nor the reality of\nthe surrounding world can be established beyond doubt. The\nhuman sense of reality demands that men actualize the sheer pas-\nsive givenness of their being, not in order to change it but in order\nto make articulate and call into full existence what otherwise they\nwould have to suffer passively anyhow . 41 This actualization re-\nsides and comes to pass in those activities that exist only in sheer\nactuality.\n\nThe only character of the world by which to gauge its reality is\nits being common to us all, and common sense occupies such a high\nrank in the hierarchy of political qualities because it is the one\nsense that fits into reality as a whole our five strictly individual\nsenses and the strictly particular data they perceive. It is by virtue\n\n40. This is a decisive feature of the Greek, though perhaps not of the Roman,\nconcept of “virtue”: where arete is, oblivion cannot occur (cf. Aristotle Nicom-\nachean Ethics 1 1 00b 1 2— 17).\n\n41. This is the meaning of the last sentence of the Dante quotation at the head\nof this chapter; the sentence, though quite clear and simple in the Latin original,\ndefies translation ( De nwmrchia i. 13).\n\n[ 208 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nof common sense that the other sense perceptions are known to\ndisclose reality and are not merely felt as irritations of our nerves\nor resistance sensations of our bodies. A noticeable decrease in\ncommon sense in any given community and a noticeable increase\nin superstition and gullibility are therefore almost infallible signs\nof alienation from the world.\n\nThis alienation — the atrophy of the space of appearance and the\nwithering of common sense — is, of course, carried to a much\ngreater extreme in the case of a laboring society than in the case\nof a society of producers. In his isolation, not only undisturbed by\nothers but also not seen and heard and confirmed by them, homo\nfaber is together not only with the product he makes but also with\nthe world of things to which he will add his own products; in this,\nalbeit indirect, way, he is still together with others who made the\nworld and who also are fabricators of things. We have already\nmentioned the exchange market on which the craftsmen meet\ntheir peers and which represents to them a common public realm\nin so far as each of them has contributed something to it. Yet while\nthe public realm as exchange market corresponds most adequately to\nthe activity of fabrication, exchange itself already belongs in the field\nof action and is by no means a mere prolongation of production; it\nis even less a mere function of automatic processes, as the buying\nof food and other means of consumption is necessarily incidental\nto laboring. Marx's contention that economic laws are like natural\nlaws, that they are not made by man to regulate the free acts of\nexchange but are functions of the productive conditions of society\nas a whole, is correct only in a laboring society, where all activi-\nties are leveled down to the human body's metabolism with nature\nand where no exchange exists but only consumption.\n\nHowever, the people who meet on the exchange market are\nprimarily not persons but producers of products, and what they\nshow there is never themselves, not even their skills and qualities\nas in the “conspicuous production” of the Middle Ages, but their\nproducts. The impulse that drives the fabricator to the public\nmarket place is the desire for products, not for people, and the\npower that holds this market together and in existence is not the\npotentiality which springs up between people when they come\ntogether in action and speech, but a combined “power of ex-\n\n[ 209 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nchange” (Adam Smith) which each of the participants acquired in\nisolation. It is this lack of relatedness to others and this primary\nconcern with exchangeable commodities which Marx denounced\nas the dehumanization and self-alienation of commercial society,\nwhich indeed excludes men qua men and demands, in striking\nreversal of the ancient relationship between private and public,\nthat men show themselves only in the privacy of their families or\nthe intimacy of their friends.\n\nThe frustration of the human person inherent in a community of\nproducers and even more in commercial society is perhaps best\nillustrated by the phenomenon of genius, in which, from the Ren-\naissance to the end of the nineteenth century, the modern age saw\nits highest ideal. (Creative genius as the quintessential expression\nof human greatness was quite unknown to antiquity or the Middle\nAges.) It is only with the beginning of our century that great\nartists in surprising unanimity have protested against being called\n“geniuses” and have insisted on craftmanship, competence, and\nthe close relationships between art and handicraft. This protest,\nto be sure, is partly no more than a reaction against the vulgariza-\ntion and commercialization of the notion of genius; but it is also\ndue to the more recent rise of a laboring society, for which pro-\nductivity or creativity is no ideal and which lacks all experiences\nfrom which the very notion of greatness can spring. What is im-\nportant in our context is that the work of genius, as distinguished\nfrom the product of the craftsman, appears to have absorbed those\nelements of distinctness and uniqueness which find their immedi-\nate expression only in action and speech. The modern age's obses-\nsion with the unique signature of each artist, its unprecedented\nsensitivity to style, shows a preoccupation with those features by\nwhich the artist transcends his skill and workmanship in a way\nsimilar to the way each person's uniqueness transcends the sum\ntotal of his qualities. Because of this transcendence, which indeed\ndistinguishes the great work of art from all other products of hu-\nman hands, the phenomenon of the creative genius seemed like the\nhighest legitimation for the conviction of homo faber that a man's\nproducts may be more and essentially greater than himself.\n\nHowever, the great reverence the modern age so willingly paid\nto genius, so frequently bordering on idolatry, could hardly change\n\n[ 210 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nthe elementary fact that the essence of who somebody is cannot\nbe reified by himself. When it appears “objectively” — in the style\nof an art work or in ordinary handwriting — it manifests the iden-\ntity of a person and therefore serves to identify authorship, but it\nremains mute itself and escapes us if we try to interpret it as the\nmirror of a living person. In other words, the idolization of genius\nharbors the same degradation of the human person as the other\ntenets prevalent in commercial society.\n\nIt is an indispensable element of human pride to believe that\nwho somebody is transcends in greatness and importance any-\nthing he can do and produce. “Let physicians and confectioners\nand the servants of the great houses be judged by what they have\ndone, and even by what they have meant to do; the great people\nthemselves are judged by what they are .” 42 Only the vulgar will\ncondescend to derive their pride from what they have done; they\nwill, by this condescension, become the “slaves and prisoners” of\ntheir own faculties and will find out, should anything more be left\nin them than sheer stupid vanity, that to be one's own slave and\nprisoner is no less bitter and perhaps even more shameful than to\nbe the servant of somebody else. It is not the glory but the pre-\ndicament of the creative genius that in his case the superiority of\nman to his work seems indeed inverted, so that he, the living\ncreator, finds himself in competition with his creations which he\noutlives, although they may survive him eventually. The saving\ngrace of all really great gifts is that the persons who bear their\nburden remain superior to what they have done, at least as long as\nthe source of creativity is alive; for this source springs indeed\nfrom who they are and remains outside the actual work process\nas well as independent of what they may achieve. That the pre-\ndicament of genius is nevertheless a real one becomes quite ap-\nparent in the case of the literati , where the inverted order between\nman and his product is in fact consummated; what is so outrageous\nin their case, and incidentally incites popular hatred even more\nthan spurious intellectual superiority, is that even their worst\nproduct is likely to be better than they are themselves. It is the\nhallmark of the “intellectual” that he remains quite undisturbed\n\n42. I use here Isak Dinesen's wonderful story “The Dreamers,” in Seven\nGothic Tales (Modern Library ed,), especially pp. 340 ff.\n\n[ 211 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nby “the terrible humiliation” under which the true artist or writer\nlabors, which is “to feel that he becomes the son of his work,” in\nwhich he is condemned to see himself “as in a mirror, limited,\nsuch and such .” 48\n\n",
        "Section 30. THE LABOR MOVEMENT": "\nThe activity of work, for which isolation from others is a neces-\nsary prerequisite, although it may not be able to establish an\nautonomous public realm in which men qua men can appear, still\nis connected with this space of appearances in many ways; at the\nvery least, it remains related to the tangible world of things it\nproduced. Workmanship, therefore, may be an unpolitical way of\nlife, but it certainly is not an antipolitical one. Yet this precisely\nis the case of laboring, an activity in which man is neither to-\ngether with the world nor with other people, but alone with his\nbody, facing the naked necessity to keep himself alive . 44 To be\nsure, he too lives in the presence of and together with others, but\nthis togetherness has none of the distinctive marks of true plurali-\nty. It does not consist in the purposeful combination of different\nskills and callings as in the case of workmanship (let alone in the\nrelationships between unique persons), but exists in the multipli-\ncation of specimens which are fundamentally all alike because\nthey are what they are as mere living organisms.\n\n43. The foil text of the aphorism of Paul Valery from which the quotations are\ntaken reads as follows: “Createur cree. Qui vient d'achever un long ouvrage le voit\nformer enfin un etre qu'il n'avait pas voulu, qu'il n'a pas congu, precisement\npuisqu'il l'a enfante, et ressent cette terrible humiliation de se sentir devenir le fils\nde son ceuvre, de lui emprunter des traits irrecusables, une ressemblance, des\nmanies, une borne, un miroir; et ce qu'il a de pire dans un miroir, s'y voir limite,\ntel et tel” (Tel quel II, 149).\n\n44. The loneliness of the laborer qua laborer is usually overlooked in the liter-\nature on the subject because social conditions and the organization of labor de-\nmand the simultaneous presence of many laborers for any given task and break\ndown all barriers of isolation. However, M. Halbwachs (La classe ouvriere et les\nniveaux de vie [1913]) is aware of the phenomenon: “L'ouvrier est celui qui dans\net par son travail ne se trouve en rapport qu'avec de la matiere, et non avec\ndes hommes” and finds in this inherent lack of contact the reason why, for so\nmany centuries, this whole class was put outside society (p. 118).\n\n[ 212 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nIt is indeed in the nature of laboring to bring men together in\nthe form of a labor gang where any number of individuals “labor\ntogether as though they were one ,” 46 and in this sense togetherness\nmay permeate laboring even more intimately than any other\nactivity . 46 But this “collective nature of labor ,” 47 far from estab-\nlishing a recognizable, identifiable reality for each member of the\nlabor gang, requires on the contrary the actual loss of all aware-\nness of individuality and identity; and it is for this reason that all\nthose “values” which derive from laboring, beyond its obvious\nfunction in the life process, are entirely “social” and essentially\nnot different from the additional pleasure derived from eating and\ndrinking in company. The sociability arising out of those activi-\nties which spring from the human body's metabolism with nature\nrest not on equality but on sameness, and from this viewpoint it\nis perfectly true that “by nature a philosopher is not in genius and\ndisposition half so different from a street porter as a mastiff is\nfrom a greyhound.” This remark of Adam Smith, which Marx\nquoted with great delight , 48 indeed fits a consumers' society much\n\n45. Viktor von Weizsacker, the German psychiatrist, describes the relation-\nship between laborers during their labor as follows: “Es ist zunachst bemerkens-\nwert, dass die zwei Arbeiter sich zusammen verhalten, als ob sie einer waren. . . .\nWir haben hier einen Fall von Kollektivbildung vor uns, der in der annahemden\nIdentitat oder Einswerdung der zwei Individuen besteht. Man kann auch sagen,\ndass zwei Personen durch Verschmelzung eine einzige dritte geworden seien;\naber die Regeln, nach der diese dritte arbeitet, unterscheiden sich in nichts von\nder Arbeit einer einzigen Person” (“Zum Begriff der Arbeit,” in Festschrift fur\nAlfred Weber [1948], pp. 739-40).\n\n46. This seems to be the reason why, etymologically, “Arbeit und Ge-\nmeinschaft fiir den Menschen alterer geschichtlicher Stufen grosse Inhaltsflachen\ngemeinsam [haben]” (for the relation between labor and community see Jost\nTrier, “Arbeit und Gemeinschaft,” Studium Generate, Vol. Ill, No. 11 [Novem-\nber, 1950]).\n\n47. See R. P. Genelli (“Facteur humain ou facteur social du travail,” Revue\nfranqaise du travail, Vol. VII, Nos. 1-3 [January-March, 1952]), who believes\nthat a “new solution of the labor problem” should be found which would take\ninto account the “collective nature of labor” and therefore provide not for the\nindividual laborer but for him as member of his group. This “new” solution is of\ncourse the one prevailing in modern society.\n\n48. Adam Smith, op. cit., 1, 1 5, and Marx, Das Elend der Philosophic (Stuttgart,\n1885), p. 125: Adam Smith “hat sehr wohl gesehen, dass ‘in Wirklichkeit die\n\n[ 213 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbetter than the gathering of people on the exchange market, which\nbrings to light the skills and qualities of the producers and thus\nalways provides some basis for distinction.\n\nThe sameness prevailing in a society resting on labor and con-\nsumption and expressed in its conformity is intimately connected\nwith the somatic experience of laboring together, where the bio-\nlogical rhythm of labor unites the group of laborers to the point\nthat each may feel that he is no longer an individual but actually\none with all others. To be sure, this eases labor's toil and trouble\nin much the same way as marching together eases the effort of\nwalking for each soldier. It is therefore quite true that for the\nanimal laborms “labor's sense and value depend entirely upon the\nsocial conditions,” that is, upon the extent to which the labor and\nconsumption process is permitted to function smoothly and easily,\nindependent of “professional attitudes properly speaking ”; 49 the\ntrouble is only that the best “social conditions” are those under\nwhich it is possible to lose one's identity. This unitedness of many\ninto one is basically antipolitical; it is the very opposite of the\ntogetherness prevailing in political or commercial communities,\nwhich— to take the Aristotelian example — consist not of an asso-\nciation ( koinonia ) between two physicians, but between a physi-\n\nVerschiedenheit der natiirlichen Anlagen zwischen den Individuen weit geringer\nist als wir glauben.' . . . Urspriinglich unterscheidet sich ein Lasttrager weniger\nvon einem Philosophen als ein Kettenhund von einem Windhund. Es ist die\nArbeitsteilung, welche einen Abgrund zwischen beiden aufgetan hat.” Marx uses\nthe term “division of labor” indiscriminately for professional specialization and\nfor the dividing of the labor process itself, but means here of course the former.\nProfessional specialization is indeed a form of distinction, and the craftsman or\nprofessional worker, even if he is helped by others, works essentially in isolation.\nHe meets others qua worker only when it comes to the exchange of products.\nIn the true division of labor, the laborer cannot accomplish anything in isolation;\nhis effort is only part and function of the effort of all laborers among whom the\ntask is divided. But these other laborers qua laborers are not different from him,\nthey are all the same. Thus, it is not the relatively recent division of labor, but the\nage-old professional specialization which “opened the gulf” between the street\nporter and the philosopher.\n\n49. Alain Touraine, V evolution du travail rnvrier am usines Renault (1955),\np. 177.\n\n\n[ 214 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\ncian and a farmer, “and in general between people who are differ-\nent and unequal.” 60\n\nThe equality attending the public realm is necessarily an equali-\nty of unequals who stand in need of being “equalized” in certain\nrespects and for specific purposes. As such, the equalizing factor\narises not from human “nature” but from outside, just as money —\nto continue the Aristotelian example — is needed as an outside fac-\ntor to equate the unequal activities of physician and farmer. Politi-\ncal equality, therefore, is the very opposite of our equality before\ndeath, which as the common fate of all men arises out of the\nhuman condition, or of equality before God, at least in its Christian\ninterpretation, where we are confronted with an equality of sin-\nfulness inherent in human nature. In these instances, no equalizer\nis needed because sameness prevails anyhow; by the same token,\nhowever, the actual experience of this sameness, the experience of\nlife and death, occurs not only in isolation but in utter loneliness,\nwhere no true communication, let alone association and commu-\nnity, is possible. From the viewpoint of the world and the public\nrealm, life and death and everything attesting to sameness are\nnon- worldly, antipolitical, truly transcendent experiences.\n\nThe incapacity of the animal laborans for distinction and hence\nfor action and speech seems to be confirmed by the striking ab-\nsence of serious slave rebellions in ancient and modern times. 61\nNo less striking, however, is the sudden and frequently extraor-\ndinarily productive role which the labor movements have played\nin modern politics. From the revolutions of 1848 to the Hungarian\nrevolution of 1956, the European working class, by virtue of being\nthe only organized and hence the leading section of the people,\nhas written one of the most glorious and probably the most prom-\nising chapter of recent history. However, although the line be-\ntween political and economic demands, between political organi-\nzations and trade unions, was blurred enough, the two should not\n\n50. Nicomachean Ethics 1133al6.\n\n5 1 . The decisive point is that modern rebellions and revolutions always asked\nfor freedom and justice for all, whereas in antiquity “slaves never raised the\ndemand of freedom as an inalienable right for all men, and there never was an\nattempt to achieve abolition of slavery as such through combined action” (W. L.\nWestermann, “Sklaverei,” in Pauly-Wissowa, Suppl. VI, p. 981).\n\n[ 215 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbe confused. The trade unions, defending and fighting for the\ninterests of the working class, are responsible for its eventual\nincorporation into modern society, especially for an extraordinary\nincrease in economic security, social prestige, and political power.\nThe trade unions were never revolutionary in the sense that they\ndesired a transformation of society together with a transformation\nof the political institutions in which this society was represented,\nand the political parties of the working class have been interest\nparties most of the time, in no way different from the parties which\nrepresented other social classes. A distinction appeared only in\nthose rare and yet decisive moments when during the process of a\nrevolution it suddenly turned out that these people, if not led by\nofficial party programs and ideologies, had their own ideas about\nthe possibilities of democratic government under modern condi-\ntions. In other words, the dividing line between the two is not a\nmatter of extreme social and economic demands but solely of the\nproposition of a new form of government.\n\nWhat is so easily overlooked by the modern historian who\nfaces the rise of totalitarian systems, especially when he deals\nwith developments in the Soviet Union, is that just as the modern\nmasses and their leaders succeeded, at least temporarily, in bring-\ning forth in totalitarianism an authentic, albeit all-destructive, new\nform of government, thus the people's revolutions, for more than\na hundred years now, have come forth, albeit never successfully,\nwith another new form of government: the system of people's\ncouncils to take the place of the Continental party system, which,\none is tempted to say, was discredited even before it came into\nexistence . 52 The historical destinies of the two trends in the work-\n\n52. It is important to keep in mind the sharp difference in substance and politi-\ncal function between the Continental party system and both the British and Amer-\nican systems. It is a decisive, though little noticed, fact in the development of\nEuropean revolutions that the slogan of Councils (Soviets, Rate, etc.) was never\nraised by the parties and movements which took an active hand in organizing\nthem, but always sprang from spontaneous rebellions; as such, the councils were\nneither properly understood nor particularly welcomed by the ideologists of the\nvarious movements who wanted to use the revolution in order to impose a precon-\nceived form of government on the people. The famous slogan of the Kronstadt\nrebellion, which was one of the decisive turning points of the Russian Revolution,\n\n[ 216 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nmg class, the trade-union movement and the people's political as-\npirations, could not be more at variance: the trade unions, that is,\nthe working class in so far as it is but one of the classes of modern\nsociety, have gone from victory to victory, while at the same time\nthe political labor movement has been defeated each time it dared\nto put forth its own demands, as distinguished from party pro-\ngrams and economic reforms. If the tragedy of the Hungarian\nrevolution achieved nothing more than that it showed the world\nthat, all defeats and all appearances notwithstanding, this political\nelan has not yet died, its sacrifices were not in vain.\n\nThis apparently flagrant discrepancy between historical fact —\nthe political productivity of the working class — and the phenomenal\ndata obtained from an analysis of the laboring activity is likely to\ndisappear upon closer inspection of the labor movement's develop-\nment and substance. The chief difference between slave labor and\nmodern, free labor is not that the laborer possesses personal free-\ndom — freedom of movement, economic activity, and personal in-\nviolability — but that he is admitted to the political realm and fully\nemancipated as a citizen. The turning point in the history of labor\ncame with the abolition of property qualifications for the right to\nvote. Up to this time the status of free labor had been very similar\nto the status of the constantly increasing emancipated slave popula-\ntion in antiquity; these men were free, being assimilated to the\nstatus of resident aliens, but not citizens. In contrast to ancient\nslave emancipations, where as a rule the slave ceased to be a laborer\nwhen he ceased to be a slave, and where, therefore, slavery re-\nmained the social condition of laboring no matter how many slaves\nwere emancipated, the modern emancipation of labor was intended\nto elevate the laboring activity itself, and this was achieved long\nbefore the laborer as a person was granted personal and civil rights.\n\nHowever, one of the important side effects of the actual emanci-\n\nwas: Soviets without Communism; and this at the time implied: Soviets without\nparties.\n\nThe thesis that the totalitarian regimes confront us with a new form of govern-\nment is explained at some length in my article, “Ideology and Terror: A Novel\nForm of Government,” Review of Politics (July, 1953). A more detailed analysis\nof the Hungarian revolution and the council system can be found in a recent\narticle, “Totalitarian Imperialism,” Journal of Politics (February, 1958).\n\n[ 2/7 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\npation of laborers was that a whole new segment of the population\nwas more or less suddenly admitted to the public realm, that is,\nappeared in public , 63 and this without at the same time being ad-\nmitted to society, without playing any leading role in the all-impor-\ntant economic activities of this society, and without, therefore,\nbeing absorbed by the social realm and, as it were, spirited away\nfrom the public. The decisive role of mere appearance, of distin-\nguishing oneself and being conspicuous in the realm of human\naffairs is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in the fact that\nlaborers, when they entered the scene of history, felt it necessary\nto adopt a costume of their own, the sans-culotte, from which, dur-\ning the French Revolution, they even derived their name . 64 By this\ncostume they won a distinction of their own, and the distinction\nwas directed against all others.\n\nThe very pathos of the labor movement in its early stages— and\nit is still in its early stages in all countries where capitalism has not\nreached its full development, in Eastern Europe, for example, but\nalso in Italy or Spain and even in France — stemmed from its fight\nagainst society as a whole. The enormous power potential these\nmovements acquired in a relatively short time and often under very\n\n53, An anecdote, reported by Seneca from imperial Rome, may illustrate how\ndangerous mere appearance in public was thought to be. At that time a proposition\nwas laid before the senate to have slaves dress uniformly in public so that they\ncould immediately be distinguished from free citizens. The proposition was turned\ndown as too dangerous, since the slaves would now be able to recognize each\nother and become aware of their potential power. Modern interpreters were of\ncourse inclined to conclude from this incident that the number of slaves at the\ntime must have been very great, yet this conclusion turned out to be quite er-\nroneous. What the sound political instinct of the Romans judged to be dangerous\nwas appearance as such, quite independent from the number of people involved\n(see Westermann, op. cit., p. 1000).\n\n54. A. Soboul (“Problemes de travail en Fan II,” Journal de psychology normale\net pathologique, Vol. LH, No. 1 [January-March, 1955]) describes very well how\nthe workers made their first appearance on the historical scene: “Les travailleurs\nne sont pas designes par leur fonction sociale, mais simplement par leur costume.\nLes ouvriers adopterent le pantalon boutonne a la veste, et ce costume devint une\ncaracteristique du peuple: des sans-culottes . . . ‘en parlant des sms-culottes, de-\nclare Petion a la Convention, le 10 avril 1793, on n'entend pas tous les citoyens,\nles nobles et les aristocrates exceptes, mais on entend des hommes qui n'ont pas,\npour les distinguer de ceux qui ont.' ”\n\n[ 218 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nadverse circumstances sprang from the fact that despite all the talk\nand theory they were the only group on the political scene which\nnot only defended its economic interests but fought a full-fledged\npolitical battle. In other words, when the labor movement ap-\npeared on the public scene, it was the only organization in which\nmen acted and spoke qua men — and not qua members of society.\n\nFor this political and revolutionary role of the labor movement,\nwhich in all probability is nearing its end, it is decisive that the\neconomic activity of its members was incidental and that its force\nof attraction was never restricted to the ranks of the working class.\nIf for a time it almost looked as if the movement would succeed in\nfounding, at least within its own ranks, a new public space with\nnew political standards, the spring of these attempts was not la-\nbor — neither the laboring activity itself nor the always utopian re-\nbellion against life's necessity — but those injustices and hypocrisies\nwhich have disappeared with the transformation of a class society\ninto a mass society and with the substitution of a guaranteed an-\nnual wage for daily or weekly pay.\n\nThe workers today are no longer outside of society; they are its\nmembers, and they are jobholders like everybody else. The politi-\ncal significance of the labor movement is now the same as that of\nany other pressure group; the time is past when, as for nearly a\nhundred years, it could represent the people as a whole — if we\nunderstand by le peuple the actual political body, distinguished as\nsuch from the population as well as from society. 55 (In the Hun-\ngarian revolution the workers were in no way distinguished from\nthe rest of the people; what from 1848 to 1918 had been almost a\nmonopoly of the working class — the notion of a parliamentary sys-\ntem based on councils instead of parties — had now become the unan-\nimous demand of the whole people.) The labor movement, equivocal\nin its content and aims from the beginning, lost this representation\nand hence its political role at once wherever the working class be-\ncame an integral part of society, a social and economic power of its\nown as in the most developed economies of the Western world, or\n\n55. Originally, the term le peuple, which became current at the end of the\neighteenth century, designated simply those who had no property. As we men-\ntioned before, such a class of completely destitute people was not known prior to\nthe modern age.\n\n\n[ 219 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhere it “succeeded” in transforming the whole population into a\nlabor society as in Russia and as may happen elsewhere even under\nnon-totalitarian conditions. Under circumstances where even the\nexchange market is being abolished, the withering of the public\nrealm, so conspicuous throughout the modern age, may well find its\nconsummation.\n",
        "Section 31. THE TRADITIONAL SUBSTITUTION OF MAKING FOR ACTING": "\nThe modern age, in its early concern with tangible products and\ndemonstrable profits or its later obsession with smooth functioning\nand sociability, was not the first to denounce the idle uselessness of\naction and speech in particular and of politics in general . 66 Exasper-\nation with the threefold frustration of action — the unpredictability\nof its outcome, the irreversibility of the process, and the anonymity\nof its authors — is almost as old as recorded history. It has always\nbeen a great temptation, for men of action no less than for men of\nthought, to find a substitute for action in the hope that the realm of\nhuman affairs may escape the haphazardness and moral irresponsi-\nbility inherent in a plurality of agents. The remarkable monotony\nof the proposed solutions throughout our recorded history testifies\nto the elemental simplicity of the matter. Generally speaking, they\nalways amount to seeking shelter from action's calamities in an\nactivity where one man, isolated from all others, remains master of\nhis doings from beginning to end. This attempt to replace acting\nwith making is manifest in the whole body of argument against\n“democracy,” which, the more consistently and better reasoned\nit is, will turn into an argument against the essentials of politics.\n\nThe calamities of action all arise from the human condition of\nplurality, which is the condition sine qua non for that space of ap-\npearance which is the public realm. Hence the attempt to do away\nwith this plurality is always tantamount to the abolition of the pub-\nlic realm itself. The most obvious salvation from the dangers of\n\n56. The classic author on this matter is still Adam Smith, to whom the only\nlegitimate function of government is “the defence of the rich against the poor, or\nof those who have some property against those who have none at all” (op. cit., II,\n198 IF.; for the quotation see II, 203).\n\n[ 220 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nplurality is mon-archy, or one-man-rule, in its many varieties, from\noutright tyranny of one against all to benevolent despotism and to\nthose forms of democracy in which the many form a collective\nbody so that the people “is many in one” and constitute themselves\nas a “monarch .” 67 Plato's solution of the philosopher-king, whose\n“wisdom” solves the perplexities of action as though they were\nsolvable problems of cognition, is only one — and by no means the\nleast tyrannical — variety of one-man rule. The trouble with these\nforms of government is not that they are cruel, which often they\nare not, but rather that they work too well. Tyrants, if they know\ntheir business, may well be “kindly and mild in everything,” like\nPeisistratus, whose rule even in antiquity was compared to “the\nGolden Age of Cronos ”; 68 their measures may sound very “un-\ntyrannical” and beneficial to modern ears, especially when we hear\nthat the only- — albeit unsuccessful — attempt to abolish slavery in\nantiquity was made by Periandros, tyrant of Corinth . 69 But they\nall have in common the banishment of the citizens from the public\nrealm and the insistence that they mind their private business while\nonly “the ruler should attend to public affairs .” 60 This, to be sure,\n\n57. This is the Aristotelian interpretation of tyranny in the form of a democ-\nracy ( Politics 1292al6 ff.) . Kingship, however, does not belong among the tyran-\nnical forms of government, nor can it be defined as one-man rule or monarchy.\nWhile the terms “tyranny” and “monarchy” could be used interchangeably, the\nwords “tyrant” and basileus (“king”) are used as opposites (see, for instance,\nAristotle Nicomachean Ethics 1 1 60b 3 ; Plato Republic 576D). Generally speaking,\none-man rale is praised in antiquity only for household matters or for warfare,\nand it is usually in some military or “economic” context that the famous line from\nthe Iliad, auk agathon polykoiranie; heis koiranos esto, heis basileus — “the rule by\nmany is not good; one should be master, one be king” (ii. 204) — is quoted.\n(Aristotle, who applies Homer's saying in his Metaphysics [1076a3 ff.] to political\ncommunity life [ politeuesthai ] in a metaphorical sense, is an exception. In Politics\n1 292al 3, where he quotes the Homeric line again, he takes a stand against the\nmany having the power “not as individuals, but collectively,” and states that this\nis only a disguised form of one-man rule, or tyranny.) Conversely, the rule of the\nmany, later called polyarkhia, is used disparagingly to mean confusion of com-\nmand in warfare (see, for instance, Thucydides vi. 72; cf. Xenophon Anabasis\nvi. 1. 18).\n\n58. Aristotle Athenian Constitution xvi. 2, 7.\n\n59. See Fritz Heichelheim, Wirtschaftsgeschichte des Altertums (1938), I, 258.\n\n60. Aristotle ( Athenian Constitution xv. 5) reports this of Peisistratus.\n\n[ 221 }\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwas tantamount to furthering private industry and industriousness,\nbut the citizens could see in this policy nothing but the attempt to\ndeprive them of the time necessary for participation in common\nmatters. It is the obvious short-range advantages of tyranny, the\nadvantages of stability, security, and productivity, that one should\nbeware, if only because they pave the way to an inevitable loss of\npower, even though the actual disaster may occur in a relatively\ndistant future.\n\nEscape from the frailty of human affairs into the solidity of quiet\nand order has in fact so much to recommend it that the greater part\nof political philosophy since Plato could easily be interpreted as\nvarious attempts to find theoretical foundations and practical ways\nfor an escape from politics altogether. The hallmark of all such\nescapes is the concept of rule, that is, the notion that men can law-\nfully and politically live together only when some are entitled to\ncommand and the others forced to obey. The commonplace notion\nalready to be found in Plato and Aristotle that every political com-\nmunity consists of those who rule and those who are ruled (on\nwhich assumption in turn are based the current definitions of forms\nof government — rule by one or monarchy, rule by few or oli-\ngarchy, rule by many or democracy) rests on a suspicion of action\nrather than on a contempt for men, and arose from the earnest\ndesire to find a substitute for action rather than from any irrespon-\nsible or tyrannical will to power.\n\nTheoretically, the most brief and most fundamental version of\nthe escape from action into rule occurs in the Statesman, where\nPlato opens a gulf between the two modes of action, archein and\nprattein (“beginning” and “achieving”), which according to Greek\nunderstanding were interconnected. The problem, as Plato saw it,\nwas to make sure that the beginner would remain the complete\nmaster of what he had begun, not needing the help of others to\ncarry it through. In the realm of action, this isolated mastership\ncan be achieved only if the others are no longer needed to join the\nenterprise of their own accord, with their own motives and aims,\nbut are used to execute orders, and if, on the other hand, the be-\nginner who took the initiative does not permit himself to get in-\nvolved in the action itself. To begin ( archein ) and to act (prattein )\nthus can become two altogether different activities, and the begin-\n\n[ 222 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nner has become a ruler (an archon in the twofold sense of the word)\nwho “does not have to act at all ( prattein ), but rules ( archein ) over\nthose who are capable of execution.” Under these circumstances,\nthe essence of politics is “to know how to begin and to rule in the\ngravest matters with regard to timeliness and untimeliness”; action\nas such is entirely eliminated and has become the mere “execution\nof orders .” 61 Plato was the first to introduce the division between\nthose who know and do not act and those who act and do not know,\ninstead of the old articulation of action into beginning and achiev-\ning, so that knowing what to do and doing it became two alto-\ngether different performances.\n\nSince Plato himself immediately identified the dividing line be-\ntween thought and action with the gulf which separates the rulers\nfrom those over whom they rule, it is obvious that the experiences\non which the Platonic division rests are those of the household,\nwhere nothing would ever be done if the master did not know what\nto do and did not give orders to the slaves who executed them with-\nout knowing. Here indeed, he who knows does not have to do and\nhe who does needs no thought or knowledge. Plato was still quite\naware that he proposed a revolutionary transformation of the polls\nwhen he applied to its administration the currently recognized\nmaxims for a well-ordered household . 62 (It is a common error to\ninterpret Plato as though he wanted to abolish the family and the\nhousehold; he wanted, on the contrary, to extend this type of life\nuntil one family embraced every citizen. In other words, he wanted\nto eliminate from the household community its private character,\nand it is for this purpose that he recommended the abolition of pri-\nvate property and individual marital status .) 63 According to Greek\nunderstanding, the relationship between ruling and being ruled,\n\n61. Statesman 305.\n\n62. It is the decisive contention of the Statesman that no difference existed\nbetween the constitution of a large household and that of the polls (see 259), so\nthat the same science would cover political and “economic” or household matters.\n\n63. This is particularly manifest in those passages of the fifth book of the\nRepublic in which Plato describes how the fear lest one attack his own son,\nbrother, or father would further general peace in his utopian republic. Because of\nthe community of women, nobody would know who his blood relatives were\n(see esp. 463C and 465B).\n\n\n[ 225 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nbetween command and obedience, was by definition identical with\nthe relationship between master and slaves and therefore precluded\nall possibility of action. Plato's contention, therefore, that the rules\nof behavior in public matters should be derived from the master-\nslave relationship in a well-ordered household actually meant that\naction should not play any part in human affairs.\n\nIt is obvious that Plato's scheme offers much greater chances for\na permanent order in human affairs than the tyrant's efforts to\neliminate everybody but himself from the public realm. Although\neach citizen would retain some part in the handling of public af-\nfairs, they would indeed “act” like one man without even the pos-\nsibility of internal dissension, let alone factional strife: through\nrule, “the many become one in every respect” except bodily ap-\npearance . 64 Historically, the concept of rule, though originating in\nthe household and family realm, has played its most decisive part\nin the organization of public matters and is for us invariably con-\nnected with politics. This should not make us overlook the fact\nthat for Plato it was a much more general category. He saw in it\nthe chief device for ordering and judging human affairs in every\nrespect. This is not only evident from his insistence that the city-\nstate must be considered to be “man writ large” and from his con-\nstruction of a psychological order which actually follows the pub-\nlic order of his utopian city, but is even more manifest in the\ngrandiose consistency with which he introduced the principle of\ndomination into the intercourse of man with himself. The supreme\ncriterion of fitness for ruling others is, in Plato and in the aristocrat-\nic tradition of the West, the capacity to rule one's self. Just as the\nphilosopher-king commands the city, the soul commands the body\nand reason commands the passions. In Plato himself, the legitimacy\nof this tyranny in everything pertaining to man, his conduct toward\nhimself no less than his conduct toward others, is still firmly\nrooted in the equivocal significance of the word archein, which\nmeans both beginning and ruling; it is decisive for Plato, as he says\nexpressly at the end of the Laws, that only the beginning ( arche ) is\nentitled to rule {archein ) . In the tradition of Platonic thought, this\noriginal, linguistically predetermined identity of ruling and begin-\nning had the consequence that all beginning was understood as the\n\n64. Republic 443E.\n\n\n[ 224 ]\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nlegitimation for rulership, until, finally, the element of beginning\ndisappeared altogether from the concept of rulership. With it the\nmost elementary and authentic understanding of human freedom\ndisappeared from political philosophy.\n\nThe Platonic separation of knowing and doing has remained at\nthe root of all theories of domination which are not mere justifica-\ntions of an irreducible and irresponsible will to power. By sheer\nforce of conceptualization and philosophical clarification, the Pla-\ntonic identification of knowledge with command and rulership and\nof action with obedience and execution overruled all earlier experi-\nences and articulations in the political realm and became authorita-\ntive for the whole tradition of political thought, even after the\nroots of experience from which Plato derived his concepts had long\nbeen forgotten. Apart from the unique Platonic mixture of depth\nand beauty, whose weight was bound to carry his thoughts through\nthe centuries, the reason for the longevity of this particular part of\nhis work is that he strengthened his substitution of rulership for\naction through an even more plausible interpretation in terms of\nmaking and fabrication. It is indeed true — and Plato, who had\ntaken the key word of his philosophy, the term “idea,” from ex-\nperiences in the realm of fabrication, must have been the first to\nnotice it — that the division between knowing and doing, so alien to\nthe realm of action, whose validity and meaningfulness are de-\nstroyed the moment thought and action part company, is an every-\nday experience in fabrication, whose processes obviously fall into\ntwo parts : first, perceiving the image or shape ( eidos ) of the prod-\nuct-to-be, and then organizing the means and starting the execu-\ntion.\n\nThe Platonic wish to substitute making for acting in order to\nbestow upon the realm of human affairs the solidity inherent in\nwork and fabrication becomes most apparent where it touches the\nvery center of his philosophy, the doctrine of ideas. When Plato\nwas not concerned with political philosophy (as in the Symposium\nand elsewhere), he describes the ideas as what “shines forth most”\n(ekphanestaton) and therefore as variations of the beautiful. Only in\nthe Republic were the ideas transformed into standards, measure-\nments, and rules of behavior, all of which are variations or deriva-\ntions of the idea of the “good” in the Greek sense of the word, that\n\n[ 22J ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nis, of the “good for” or of fitness . 65 This transformation was neces-\nsary to apply the doctrine of ideas to politics, and it is essentially\nfor a political purpose, the purpose of eliminating the character of\nfrailty from human affairs, that Plato found it necessary to declare\nthe good, and not the beautiful, to be the highest idea. But this idea\nof the good is not the highest idea of the philosopher, who wishes\nto contemplate the true essence of Being and therefore leaves the\ndark cave of human affairs for the bright sky of ideas; even in the\nRepublic , the philosopher is still defined as a lover of beauty, not of\ngoodness. The good is the highest idea of the philosopherTmg, who\nwishes to be the ruler of human affairs because he must spend his\nlife among men and cannot dwell forever under the sky of ideas.\nIt is only when he returns to the dark cave of human affairs to live\nonce more with his fellow men that he needs the ideas for guidance\nas standards and rules by which to measure and under which to\nsubsume the varied multitude of human deeds and words with the\nsame absolute, “objective” certainty with which the craftsman can\nbe guided in making and the layman in judging individual beds by\nusing the unwavering ever-present model, the “idea” of bed in\ngeneral . 66\n\nTechnically, the greatest advantage of this transformation and\napplication of the doctrine of ideas to the political realm lay in the\nelimination of the personal element in the Platonic notion of ideal\n\n65. The word ekphanestaton occurs in the Phaedrus (250) as the chief quality of\nthe beautiful. In the Republic (518) a similar quality is claimed for the idea of the\ngood, which is called phanotaton. Both words derive from phctinesthai (“to appear”\nand “shine forth”), and in both cases the superlative is used. Obviously, the\nquality of shining brightness applies to the beautiful much more than to the good.\n\n66. Werner Jaeger's statement ( Paideia [1945], II, 416 n.), “The idea that\nthere is a supreme art of measurement and that the philosopher's knowledge of\nvalue ( phronesis ) is the ability to measure, runs through all Plato's work right\ndown to the end,” is true only for Plato's political philosophy, where the idea of\nthe good replaces the idea of the beautiful. The parable of the Cave, as told in the\nRepublic , is the very center of Plato's political philosophy, but the doctrine of\nideas as presented there must be understood as its application to politics, not as\nthe original, purely philosophical development, which we cannot discuss here.\nJaeger's characterization of the “philosopher's knowledge of values” as phronesis\nindicates, in fact, the political and non-philosophical nature of this knowledge;\nfor the very word phronesis characterizes in Plato and Aristotle the insight of the\nstatesman rather than the vision of the philosopher.\n\n[ 226 ]\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nrulership. Plato knew quite well that his favorite analogies taken\nfrom household life, such as the master-slave or the shepherd-flock\nrelationship, would demand a quasi-divine quality in the ruler of\nmen to distinguish him as sharply from his subjects as the slaves are\ndistinguished from the master or the sheep from the shepherd . 67\nThe construction of the public space in the image of a fabricated\nobject, on the contrary, carried with it only the implication of or-\ndinary mastership, experience in the art of politics as in all other\narts, where the compelling factor lies not in the person of the artist\nor craftsman but in the impersonal object of his art or craft. In the\nRepublic , the philosopher-king applies the ideas as the craftsman\napplies his rules and standards; he “makes” his City as the sculptor\nmakes a statue ; 68 and in the final Platonic work these same ideas\nhave even become laws which need only be executed . 69\n\nWithin this frame of reference, the emergence of a utopian\npolitical system which could be construed in accordance with a\nmodel by somebody who has mastered the techniques of human\naffairs becomes almost a matter of course; Plato, who was the first\nto design a blueprint for the making of political bodies, has re-\nmained the inspiration of all later utopias. And although none of\nthese utopias ever came to play any noticeable role in history — for\nin the few instances where utopian schemes were realized, they\nbroke down quickly under the weight of reality, not so much the\nreality of exterior circumstances as of the real human relationships\nthey could not control — they were among the most efficient ve-\nhicles to conserve and develop a tradition of political thinking in\n\n67. In the Statesmen i, where Plato chiefly pursues this line of thought, he con-\ncludes ironically: Looking for someone who would be as fit to rule over man as\nthe shepherd is to rule over his flock, we found “a god instead of a mortal man”\n(275).\n\n68. Republic 420.\n\n69. It may be interesting to note the following development in Plato's political\ntheory: In the Republic, his division between rulers and ruled is guided by the\nrelationship between expert and layman; in the Statesman, he takes his bearings\nfrom the relation between knowing and doing; and in the Laws, the execution of\nunchangeable laws is all that is left to the statesman or necessary for the function-\ning of the public realm. What is most striking in this development is the progres-\nsive shrinkage of faculties needed for the mastering of politics.\n\n[ 227 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhich, consciously or unconsciously, the concept of action was\ninterpreted in terms of making and fabrication.\n\nOne thing, however, is noteworthy in the development of this\ntradition. It is true that violence, without which no fabrication\ncould ever come to pass, has always played an important role in\npolitical schemes and thinking based upon an interpretation of ac-\ntion in terms of making; but up to the modern age, this element of\nviolence remained strictly instrumental, a means that needed an end\nto justify and limit it, so that glorifications of violence as such are\nentirely absent from the tradition of political thought prior to the\nmodern age. Generally speaking, they were impossible as long as\ncontemplation and reason were supposed to be the highest capaci-\nties of man, because under this assumption all articulations of the\nvita activa, fabrication no less than action and let alone labor, re-\nmained themselves secondary and instrumental. Within the nar-\nrower sphere of political theory, the consequence was that the\nnotion of rule and the concomitant questions of legitimacy and\nrightful authority played a much more decisive role than the under-\nstanding and interpretations of action itself. Only the modern age's\nconviction that man can know only what he makes, that his al-\nlegedly higher capacities depend upon making and that he therefore\nis primarily homo faber and not an animal rationale , brought forth\nthe much older implications of violence inherent in all interpreta-\ntions of the realm of human affairs as a sphere of making. This has\nbeen particularly striking in the series of revolutions, characteristic\nof the modern age, all of which — with the exception of the Ameri-\ncan Revolution — show the same combination of the old Roman\nenthusiasm for the foundation of a new body politic with the\nglorification of violence as the only means for “making” it. Marx's\ndictum that “violence is the midwife of every old society pregnant\nwith a new one,” that is, of all change in history and politics , 70 only\nsums up the conviction of the whole modern age and draws the\nconsequences of its innermost belief that history is “made” by men\nas nature is “made” by God.\n\n70. The quote is from Capital (Modern Library ed.), p. 824. Other passages\nin Marx show that he does not restrict his remark to the manifestation of social or\neconomic forces. For example: “In actual history it is notorious that conquest,\nenslavement, robbery, murder, briefly violence, play the great part” {ibid., 785) .\n\n[ 228 ]\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nHow persistent and successful the transformation of action into\na mode of making has been is easily attested by the whole ter-\nminology of political theory and political thought, which indeed\nmakes it almost impossible to discuss these matters without using\nthe category of means and ends and thinking in terms of instrumen-\ntality. Perhaps even more convincing is the unanimity with which\npopular proverbs in all modern languages advise us that “he who\nwants an end must also want the means” and that “you can't make\nan omelette without breaking eggs.” We are perhaps the first gen-\neration which has become fully aware of the murderous conse-\nquences inherent in a line of thought that forces one to admit that\nall means, provided that they are efficient, are permissible and jus-\ntified to pursue something defined as an end. However, in order to\nescape these beaten paths of thought it is not enough to add some\nqualifications, such as that not all means are permissible or that\nunder certain circumstances means may be more important than\nends; these qualifications either take for granted a moral system\nwhich, as the very exhortations demonstrate, can hardly be taken\nfor granted, or they are overpowered by the very language and\nanalogies they use. For to make a statement about ends that do not\njustify all means is to speak in paradoxes, the definition of an end\nbeing precisely the justification of the means; and paradoxes al-\nways indicate perplexities, they do not solve them and hence are\nnever convincing. As long as we believe that we deal with ends and\nmeans in the political realm, we shall not be able to prevent any-\nbody's using all means to pursue recognized ends.\n\nThe substitution of making for acting and the concomitant deg-\nradation of politics into a means to obtain an allegedly “higher”\nend— in antiquity the protection of the good men from the rule of\nthe bad in general, and the safety of the philosopher in particular , 71\nin the Middle Ages the salvation of souls, in the modern age the\nproductivity and progress of society — is as old as the tradition of\npolitical philosophy. It is true that only the modern age defined\nman primarily as homo faber, a toolmaker and producer of things,\n\n71. Compare Plato's statement that the wish of the philosopher to become a\nruler of men can spring only from the fear of being ruled by those who are worse\n{Republic 347) with Augustine's statement that the function ol government is to\nenable “the good” to live more quietly among “the bad” ( Epistolae 153. 6).\n\n[ 22 * ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nand therefore could overcome the deep-seated contempt and sus-\npicion in which the tradition had held the whole sphere of fabrica-\ntion. Yet, this same tradition, in so far as it also had turned against\naction — less openly, to be sure, but no less effectively — had been\nforced to interpret acting in terms of making, and thereby, its\nsuspicion and contempt notwithstanding, had introduced into po-\nlitical philosophy certain trends and patterns of thought upon which\nthe modern age could fall back. In this respect, the modern age did\nnot reverse the tradition but rather liberated it from the “preju-\ndices” which had prevented it from declaring openly that the work\nof the craftsman should rank higher than the “idle” opinions and\ndoings which constitute the realm of human affairs. The point is\nthat Plato and, to a lesser degree, Aristotle, who thought craftsmen\nnot even worthy of full-fledged citizenship, were the first to pro-\npose handling political matters and ruling political bodies in the\nmode of fabrication. This seeming contradiction clearly indicates\nthe depth of the authentic perplexities inherent in the human capac-\nity for action and the strength of the temptation to eliminate its\nrisks and dangers by introducing into the web of human relation-\nships the much more reliable and solid categories inherent in activi-\nties with which we confront nature and build the world of the\nhuman artifice.\n",
        "Section 32. THE PROCESS CHARACTER OF ACTION": "\nThe instrumentalization of action and the degradation of politics\ninto a means for something else has of course never really suc-\nceeded in eliminating action, in preventing its being one of the\ndecisive human experiences, or in destroying the realm of human\naffairs altogether. We saw before that in our world the seeming\nelimination of labor, as the painful effort to which all human life is\nbound, had first of all the consequence that work is now performed\nin the mode of laboring, and the products of work, objects for use,\nare consumed as though they were mere consumer goods. Simi-\nlarly, the attempt to eliminate action because of its uncertainty and\nto save human affairs from their frailty by dealing with them as\nthough they were or could become the planned products of human\nmaking has first of all resulted in channeling the human capacity\n\n[ 230 ]\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nfor action, for beginning new and spontaneous processes which\nwithout men never would come into existence, into an attitude\ntoward nature which up to the latest stage of the modern age\nhad been one of exploring natural laws and fabricating objects\nout of natural material. To what an extent we have begun to\nact into nature, in the literal sense of the word, is perhaps best il-\nlustrated by a recent, casual remark of a scientist who quite seri-\nously suggested that “basic research is when I am doing what I\ndon't know what I am doing .” 72\n\nThis started harmlessly enough with the experiment in which\nmen were no longer content to observe, to register, and contem-\nplate whatever nature was willing to yield in her own appearance,\nbut began to prescribe conditions and to provoke natural processes.\nWhat then developed into an ever-increasing skill in unchaining\nelemental processes, which, without the interference of men,\nwould have lain dormant and perhaps never have come to pass, has\nfinally ended in a veritable art of “making” nature, that is, of\ncreating “natural” processes which without men would never\nexist and which earthly nature by herself seems incapable of ac-\ncomplishing, although similar or identical processes may be com-\nmonplace phenomena in the universe surrounding the earth.\nThrough the introduction of the experiment, in which we pre-\nscribed man-thought conditions to natural processes and forced\nthem to fall into man-made patterns, we eventually learned how to\n“repeat the process that goes on in the sun,” that is, how to win\nfrom natural processes on the earth those energies which without\nus develop only in the universe.\n\nThe very fact that natural sciences have become exclusively sci-\nences of process and, in their last stage, sciences of potentially ir-\nreversible, irremediable “processes of no return” is a clear indica-\ntion that, whatever the brain power necessary to start them, the\nactual underlying human capacity which alone could bring about\nthis development is no “theoretical” capacity, neither contempla-\ntion nor reason, but the human ability to act — to start new unprece-\ndented processes whose outcome remains uncertain and unpre-\n\n72. Quoted from an interview with Wernher von Braun, as reported in the\nNew York Times, December 16, 1957.\n\n[ 231 )\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndictable whether they are let loose in the human or the natural\nrealm.\n\nIn this aspect of action — all-important to the modern age, to its\nenormous enlargement of human capabilities as well as to its\nunprecedented concept and consciousness of history — processes\nare started whose outcome is unpredictable, so that uncertainty\nrather than frailty becomes the decisive character of human affairs.\nThis property of action had escaped the attention of antiquity, by\nand large, and had, to say the least, hardly found adequate articula-\ntion in ancient philosophy, to which the very concept of history as\nwe know it is altogether alien. The central concept of the two\nentirely new sciences of the modern age, natural science no less\nthan historical, is the concept of process, and the actual human ex-\nperience underlying it is action. Only because we are capable of\nacting, of starting processes of our own, can we conceive of both\nnature and history as systems of processes. It is true that this char-\nacter of modern thinking first came to the fore in the science of\nhistory, which, since Vico, has been consciously presented as a\n“new science,” while the natural sciences needed several centuries\nbefore they were forced by the very results of their triumphal\nachievements to exchange an obsolete conceptual framework for a\nvocabulary that is strikingly similar to the one used in the historical\nsciences .\n\nHowever that may be, only under certain historical circum-\nstances does frailty appear to be the chief characteristic of human\naffairs. The Greeks measured them against the ever-presence or\neternal recurrence of all natural things, and the chief Greek con-\ncern was to measure up to and become worthy of an immortality\nwhich surrounds men but which mortals do not possess. To people\nwho are not possessed by this concern with immortality, the realm\nof human affairs is bound to show an altogether different, even\nsomehow contradictory aspect, namely, an extraordinary resili-\nency whose force of persistence and continuity in time is far su-\nperior to the stable durability of the solid world of things. Whereas\nmen have always been capable of destroying whatever was the\nproduct of human hands and have become capable today even of the\npotential destruction of what man did not make— the earth and\nearthly nature — men never have been and never will be able to undo\n\n[ 232 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nor even to control reliably any of the processes they start through\naction. Not even oblivion and confusion, which can cover up so\nefficiently the origin and the responsibility for every single deed,\nare able to undo a deed or prevent its consequences. And this in-\ncapacity to undo what has been done is matched by an almost\nequally complete incapacity to foretell the consequences of any\ndeed or even to have reliable knowledge of its motives . 73\n\nWhile the strength of the production process is entirely absorbed\nin and exhausted by the end product, the strength of the action\nprocess is never exhausted in a single deed but, on the contrary,\ncan grow while its consequences multiply; what endures in the\nrealm of human affairs are these processes, and their endurance is\nas unlimited, as independent of the perishability of material and the\nmortality of men as the endurance of humanity itself. The reason\nwhy we are never able to foretell with certainty the outcome and\nend of any action is simply that action has no end. The process of a\nsingle deed can quite literally endure throughout time until man-\nkind itself has come to an end.\n\nThat deeds possess such an enormous capacity for endurance,\nsuperior to every other man-made product, could be a matter of\npride if men were able to bear its burden, the burden of irreversi-\nbility and unpredictability, from which the action process draws\nits very strength. That this is impossible, men have always known.\nThey have known that he who acts never quite knows what he is\ndoing, that he always becomes “guilty” of consequences he never\nintended or even foresaw, that no matter how disastrous and unex-\npected the consequences of his deed he can never undo it, that the\nprocess he starts is never consummated unequivocally in one single\ndeed or event, and that its very meaning never discloses itself to\nthe actor but only to the backward glance of the historian who\nhimself does not act. All this is reason enough to turn away with\ndespair from the realm of human affairs and to hold in contempt\nthe human capacity for freedom, which, by producing the web of\nhuman relationships, seems to entangle its producer to such an ex-\n\n73. “Man weiss die Herkunft nieht, man weiss die Folgen nicht . . . fder\nWert der Handlung ist] unbekannt,” as Nietzsche once put it (Wille zur Macht,\nNo. 291), hardly aware that he only echoed the age-old suspicion of the philoso-\npher against action.\n\n\n[ 255 1\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntent that he appears much more the victim and the sufferer than the\nauthor and doer of what he has done. Nowhere, in other words,\nneither in labor, subject to the necessity of life, nor in fabrication,\ndependent upon given material, does man appear to be less free\nthan in those capacities whose very essence is freedom and in that\nrealm which owes its existence to nobody and nothing but man.\n\nIt is in accordance with the great tradition of Western thought to\nthink along these lines : to accuse freedom of luring man into neces-\nsity, to condemn action, the spontaneous beginning of something\nnew, because its results fall into a predetermined net of relation-\nships, invariably dragging the agent with them, who seems to for-\nfeit his freedom the very moment he makes use of it. The only\nsalvation from this kind of freedom seems to lie in non-acting, in\nabstention from the whole realm of human affairs as the only\nmeans to safeguard one's sovereignty and integrity as a person. If\nwe leave aside the disastrous consequences of these recommenda-\ntions (which materialized into a consistent system of human be-\nhavior only in Stoicism), their basic error seems to lie in that\nidentification of sovereignty with freedom which has always been\ntaken for granted by political as well as philosophic thought. If it\nwere true that sovereignty and freedom are the same, then indeed\nno man could be free, because sovereignty, the ideal of uncom-\npromising self-sufficiency and mastership, is contradictory to the\nvery condition of plurality. No man can be sovereign because not\none man, but men, inhabit the earth — and not, as the tradition since\nPlato holds, because of man's limited strength, which makes him\ndepend upon the help of others. All the recommendations the tradi-\ntion has to offer to overcome the condition of non-sovereignty and\nwin an untouchable integrity of the human person amount to a\ncompensation for the intrinsic “weakness” of plurality. Yet, if\nthese recommendations were followed and this attempt to over-\ncome the consequences of plurality were successful, the result\nwould be not so much sovereign domination of one's self as ar-\nbitrary domination of all others, or, as in Stoicism, the exchange of\nthe real world for an imaginary one where these others would\nsimply not exist.\n\nIn other words, the issue here is not strength or weakness in the\nsense of self-sufficiency. In polytheist systems, for instance, even a\n\n[ 234 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\ngod, no matter how powerful, cannot be sovereign; only under the\nassumption of one god (“One is one and all alone and evermore\nshall be so”) can sovereignty and freedom be the same. Under all\nother circumstances, sovereignty is possible only in imagination,\npaid for by the price of reality. Just as Epicureanism rests on the\nillusion of happiness when one is roasted alive in the Phaleric Bull,\nStoicism rests on the illusion of freedom when one is enslaved.\nBoth illusions testify to the psychological power of imagination,\nbut this power can exert itself only as long as the reality of the\nworld and the living, where one is and appears to be either happy or\nunhappy, either free or slave, are eliminated to such an extent that\nthey are not even admitted as spectators to the spectacle of self-\ndelusion.\n\nIf we look upon freedom with the eyes of the tradition, identi-\nfying freedom with sovereignty, the simultaneous presence of free-\ndom and non-sovereignty, of being able to begin something new\nand of not being able to control or even foretell its consequences,\nseems almost to force us to the conclusion that human existence is\nabsurd . 74 In view of human reality and its phenomenal evidence, it\nis indeed as spurious to deny human freedom to act because the\nactor never remains the master of his acts as it is to maintain that\nhuman sovereignty is possible because of the incontestable fact of\nhuman freedom . 76 'I he question which then arises is whether our\nnotion that freedom and non- sovereignty are mutually exclusive is\n\n74. This “existentialist” conclusion is much less due to an authentic revision\nof traditional concepts and standards than it appears to be; actually, it still oper-\nates within the tradition and with traditional concepts, though in a certain spirit of\nrebellion. The most consistent result of this rebellion is therefore a return to\n“religious values” which, however, have no root any longer in authentic religious\nexperiences or faith, but are like all modern spiritual “values,” exchange values,\nobtained in this case for the discarded “values” of despair.\n\n75. Where human pride is still intact, it is tragedy rather than absurdity\nwhich is taken to be the hallmark of human existence. Its greatestyepresentative\nis Kant, to whom the spontaneity of acting, and the concomitant faculties of prac-\ntical reason, including force of judgment, remain the outstanding qualities of man,\neven though his action falls into the determinism of natural laws and his judgment\ncannot penetrate the secret of absolute reality (the Ding an sich ) . Kant had the\ncourage to acquit man from the consequences of his deed, insisting solely on the\npurity of his motives, and this saved him from losing faith in man and his potential\ngreatness,\n\n\n[ 25J ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nnot defeated by reality, or to put it another way, whether the\ncapacity for action does not harbor within itself certain potentiali-\nties which enable it to survive the disabilities of non-sovereignty.\n",
        "Section 33. IRREVERSIBILITY AND THE POWER TO FORGIVE": "\nWe have seen that the animal laborans could be redeemed from its\npredicament of imprisonment in the ever-recurring cycle of the\nlife process, of being forever subject to the necessity of labor and\nconsumption, only through the mobilization of another human ca-\npacity, the capacity for making, fabricating, and producing of homo\nfaber, who as a toolmaker not only eases the pain and trouble of\nlaboring but also erects a world of durability. The redemption of\nlife, which is sustained by labor, is worldliness, which is sustained\nby fabrication. We saw furthermore that homo faber could be re-\ndeemed from his predicament of meaninglessness, the “devaluation\nof all values,” and the impossibility of finding valid standards in a\nworld determined by the category of means and ends, only through\nthe interrelated faculties of action and speech, which produce\nmeaningful stories as naturally as fabrication produces use objects.\nIf it were not outside the scope of these considerations, one could\nadd the predicament of thought to these instances; for thought, too,\nis unable to “think itself” out of the predicaments which the very\nactivity of thinking engenders. What in each of these instances\nsaves man— man qua animal laborans , qua homo faber, qua thinker —\nis something altogether different; it comes from the outside — not,\nto be sure, outside of man, but outside of each of the respective\nactivities. From the viewpoint of the animal laborans , it is like a\nmiracle that it is also a being which knows of and inhabits a world;\nfrom the viewpoint of ho'/no faber , it is like a miracle, like the\nrevelation of divinity, that meaning should have a place in this\nworld.\n\nThe case of action and action's predicaments is altogether dif-\nferent. Here, the remedy against the irreversibility and unpre-\ndictability of the process started by acting does not arise out of\nanother and possibly higher faculty, but is one of the potentialities\n\n[ 236 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nof action itself. The possible redemption from the predicament of\nirreversibility — of being unable to undo what one has done though\none did not, and could not, have known what he was doing — is\nthe faculty of forgiving. The remedy for unpredictability, for the\nchaotic uncertainty of the future, is contained in the faculty to\nmake and keep promises. The two faculties belong together in so\nfar as one of them, forgiving, serves to undo the deeds of the past,\nwhose “sins” hang like Damocles' sword over every new genera-\ntion; and the other, binding oneself through promises, serves to\nset up in the ocean of uncertainty, which the future is by definition,\nislands of security without which not even continuity, let alone\ndurability of any kind, would be possible in the relationships be-\ntween men.\n\nWithout being forgiven, released from the consequences of what\nwe have done, our capacity to act would, as it were, be confined to\none single deed from which we could never recover; we would\nremain the victims of its consequences forever, not unlike the\nsorcerer's apprentice who lacked the magic formula to break the\nspell. Without being bound to the fulfilment of promises, we would\nnever be able to keep our identities; we would be condemned to\nwander helplessly and without direction in the darkness of each\nman's lonely heart, caught in its contradictions and equivocalities\n\na darkness which only the light shed over the public realm\nthrough the presence of others, who confirm the identity between\nthe one who promises and the one who fulfils, can dispel. Both\nfaculties, therefore, depend on plurality, on the presence and acting\nof others, for no one can forgive himself and no one can feei bound\nby a promise made only to himself; forgiving and promising en-\nacted in solitude or isolation remain without reality and can signify\nno more than a role played before one's self.\n\nSince these faculties correspond so closely to the human condi-\ntion of plurality, their role in politics establishes a diametrically\ndifferent set of guiding principles from the “moral” standards in-\nherent in the Platonic notion of rule. For Platonic rulership, whose\nlegitimacy rested upon the domination of the self, draws its guiding\nprinciples — those which at the same time justify and limit power\nover others — from a relationship established between me and my-\nself, so that the right and wrong of relationships with others are\n\n[ 237 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndetermined by attitudes toward one's self, until the whole of the\npublic realm is seen in the image of “man writ large,” of the right\norder between man's individual capacities of mind, soul, and body.\nThe moral code, on the other hand, inferred from the faculties of\nforgiving and of.making promises, rests on experiences which no-\nbody could ever have with himself, which, on the contrary, are\nentirely based on the presence of others. And just as the extent and\nmodes of self-rule justify and determine rule over others — how one\nrules himself, he will rule others— thus the extent and modes of\nbeing forgiven and being promised determine the extent and modes\nin which one may be able to forgive himself or keep promises\nconcerned only with himself.\n\nBecause the remedies against the enormous strength and resili-\nency inherent in action processes can function only under the con-\ndition of plurality, it is very dangerous to use this faculty in any\nbut the realm of human affairs. Modern natural science and tech-\nnology, which no longer observe or take material from or imitate\nprocesses of nature but seem actually to act into it, seem, by the\nsame token, to have carried irreversibility and human unpredicta-\nbility into the natural realm, where no remedy can be found to\nundo what has been done. Similarly, it seems that one of the great\ndangers of acting in the mode of making and within its categorical\nframework of means and ends lies in the concomitant self-depriva-\ntion of the remedies inherent only in action, so that one is bound\nnot only to do with the means of violence necessary for all fabrica-\ntion, but also to undo what he has done as he undoes an unsuccessful\nobject, by means of destruction. Nothing appears more manifest in\nthese attempts than the greatness of human power, whose source\nlies in the capacity to act, and which without action's inherent\nremedies inevitably begins to overpower and destroy not man\nhimself but the conditions under which life was given to him.\n\nThe discoverer of the role of forgiveness in the realm of human\naffairs was Jesus of Nazareth. The fact that he made this discovery\nin a religious context and articulated it in religious language is no\nreason to take it any less seriously in a strictly secular sense. It has\nbeen in the nature of our tradition of political thought (and for\nreasons we cannot explore here) to be highly selective and to ex-\nclude from articulate conceptualization a great variety of authentic\n\n[ 238 }\n\n\nAction\n\n\npolitical experiences, among which we need not be surprised to\nfind some of an even elementary nature. Certain aspects of the\nteaching of Jesus of Nazareth which are not primarily related to\nthe Christian religious message but sprang from experiences in the\nsmall and closely knit community of his followers, bent on chal-\nlenging the public authorities in Israel, certainly belong among\nthem, even though they have been neglected because of their al-\nlegedly exclusively religious nature. The only rudimentary sign of\nan awareness that forgiveness may be the necessary corrective for\nthe inevitable damages resulting from action may be seen in the\nRoman principle to spare the vanquished (par cere subiectis ) — a wis-\ndom entirely unknown to the Greeks — or in the right to commute\nthe death sentence, probably also of Roman origin, which is the\nprerogative of nearly all Western heads of state.\n\nIt is decisive in our context that Jesus maintains against the\n“scribes and pharisees” first that it is not true that only God has\nthe power to forgive , 76 and second that this power does not derive\nfrom God — as though God, not men, would forgive through the\nmedium of human beings — but on the contrary must be mobilized\nby men toward each other before they can hope to be forgiven by\nGod also. Jesus' formulation is even more radical. Man in the\ngospel is not supposed to forgive because God forgives and he\nmust do “likewise,” but “if ye from your hearts forgive,” God\nshall do “likewise .” 77 The reason for the insistence on a duty to\nforgive is clearly “for they know not what they do” and it does\nnot apply to the extremity of crime and willed evil, for then it\nwould not have been necessary to teach: “And if he trespass\n\n76. This is stated emphatically in Luke 5:21-24 (cf. Matt. 9:4-6 or Mark\n12:7-10), where Jesus performs a miracle to prove that “the Son of man hath\npower upon earth to forgive sins,” the emphasis being on “upon earth.” It is his\ninsistence on the “power to forgive,” even more than his performance of miracles,\nthat shocks the people, so that “they that sat at meat with him began to say\nwithin themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?” (Luke 7:49).\n\n77. Matt. 18 : 35; cf. Mark 11 :25; “And when ye stand praying, forgive, . . .\nthat your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” Or:\n“If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:\nBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your\ntrespasses” (Matt. 6: 14-15). In all these instances, the power to forgive is pri-\nmarily a human power: God forgives “us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”\n\n[ 239 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nagainst thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day turn again\nto thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him .” 78 Crime and\nwilled evil are rare, even rarer perhaps than good deeds; according\nto Jesus, they will be taken care of by God in the Last Judgment,\nwhich plays no role whatsoever in life on earth, and the Last Judg-\nment is not characterized by forgiveness but by just retribution\n(apodounai) . 79 But trespassing is an everyday occurrence which is in\nthe very nature of action's constant establishment of new relation-\nships within a web of relations, and it needs forgiving, dismissing,\nin order to make it possible for life to go on by constantly releasing\nmen from what they have done unknowingly . 80 Only through this\nconstant mutual release from what they do can men remain free\nagents, only by constant willingness to change their minds and\nstart again can they be trusted with so great a power as that to\nbegin something new.\n\nIn this respect, forgiveness is the exact opposite of vengeance,\nwhich acts in the form of re-acting against an original trespassing,\nwhereby far from putting an end to the consequences of the first\nmisdeed, everybody remains bound to the process, permitting the\nchain reaction contained in every action to take its unhindered\n\n78. Luke 17:3-4. It is important to keep in mind that the three key words of\nthe text — aphienai, metanoein, and hamartanein — carry certain connotations even in\nNew Testament Greek which the translations fail to render fully. The original\nmeaning of aphienai is “dismiss” and “release” rather than “forgive”; metanoein\nmeans “change of mind” and— since it serves also to render the Hebrew shuv —\n“return,” “trace back one's steps,” rather than “repentance” with its psychologi-\ncal emotional overtones; what is required is: change your mind and “sin no\nmore,” which is almost the opposite of doing penance. Hamartanein , finally, is in-\ndeed very well rendered by “trespassing” in so far as it means rather “to miss,”\n“fail and go astray,” than “to sin” (see Heinrich Ebeling, Griechisck-deutsches\nWorterbuch zum Neuen Testamente [1923]). The verse which I quote in the stand-\nard translation could also be rendered as follows: “And if he trespass against\nthee . . . and . . . turn again to thee, saying, / changed my mind ; thou shalt\nrelease him.”\n\n79. Matt. 16:27.\n\n80. This interpretation seems justified by the context (Luke 17 :l-5): Jesus\nintroduces his words by pointing to the inevitability of “offenses” ( skandala )\nwhich are unforgivable, at least on earth; for “woe unto him, through whom they\ncome! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he\ncast into the sea”; and then continues by teaching forgiveness for “trespassing”\n(hamartanein ) .\n\n\n[ 240 ]\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\ncourse. In contrast to revenge, which is the natural, automatic re-\naction to transgression and which because of the irreversibility of\nthe action process can be expected and even calculated, the act of\nforgiving can never be predicted; it is the only reaction that acts in\nan unexpected way and thus retains, though being a reaction, some-\nthing of the original character of action. Forgiving, in other words,\nis the only reaction which does not merely re-act but acts anew and\nunexpectedly, unconditioned by the act which provoked it and\ntherefore freeing from its consequences both the one who forgives\nand the one who is forgiven. The freedom contained in Jesus' teach-\nings of forgiveness is the freedom from vengeance, which incloses\nboth doer and sufferer in the relentless automatism of the action\nprocess, which by itself need never come to an end.\n\nThe alternative to forgiveness, but by no means its opposite, is\npunishment, and both have in common that they attempt to put an\nend to something that without interference could go on endlessly.\nIt is therefore quite significant, a structural element in the realm of\nhuman affairs, that men are unable to forgive what they cannot\npunish and that they are unable to punish what has turned out to be\nunforgivable. This is the true hallmark of those offenses which,\nsince Kant, we call “radical evil” and about whose nature so little\nis known, even to us who have been exposed to one of their rare\noutbursts on the public scene. All we know is that we can neither\npunish nor forgive such offenses and that they therefore transcend\nthe realm of human affairs and the potentialities of human power,\nboth of which they radically destroy wherever they make their\nappearance. Here, where the deed itself dispossesses us of all\npower, we can indeed only repeat with Jesus: “It were better for\nhim that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into\nthe sea.”\n\nPerhaps the most plausible argument that forgiving and acting\nare as closely connected as destroying and making comes from that\naspect of forgiveness where the undoing of what was done seems\nto show the same revelatory character as the deed itself. Forgiving\nand the relationship it establishes is always an eminently personal\n(though not necessarily individual or private) affair in which what\nwas done is forgiven for the sake of who did it. This, too, was\nclearly recognized by Jesus (“Her sins which are many are for-\n\n[ 241 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ngiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the\nsame loveth little”), and it is the reason for the current conviction\nthat only love has the power to forgive. For love, although it is one\nof the rarest occurrences in human lives , 81 indeed possesses an\nunequaled power of self-revelation and an unequaled clarity of\nvision for the disclosure of who, precisely because it is uncon-\ncerned to the point of total unworldliness with what the loved per-\nson may be, with his qualities and shortcomings no less than with\nhis achievements, failings, and transgressions. Love, by reason of\nits passion, destroys the in-between which relates us to and sepa-\nrates us from others. As long as its spell lasts, the only in-between\nwhich can insert itself between two lovers is the child, love's own\nproduct. The child, this in-between to which the lovers now are\nrelated and which they hold in common, is representative of the\nworld in that it also separates them; it is an indication that they\nwill insert a new world into the existing world . 82 Through the\nchild, it is as though the lovers return to the world from which\ntheir love had expelled them. But this new worldliness, the pos-\nsible result and the only possibly happy ending of a love affair, is,\nin a sense, the end of love, which must either overcome the partners\nanew or be transformed into another mode of belonging together.\nLove, by its very nature, is unworldly, and it is for this reason\nrather than its rarity that it is not only apolitical but antipolitical,\nperhaps the most powerful of all antipolitical human forces.\n\nIf it were true, therefore, as Chrsitianity assumed, that only love\ncan forgive because only love is fully receptive to who somebody\n\n81. The common prejudice that love is as common as “romance” may be due\nto the fact that we all learned about it first through poetry. But the poets fool us;\nthey are the only ones to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable\nexperience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.\n\n82. This world-creating faculty of love is not the same as fertility, upon which\nmost creation myths are based. The following mythological tale, on the contrary,\ndraws its imagery clearly from the experience of love: the sky is seen as a gigantic\ngoddess who still bends down upon the earth god, from whom she is being sepa-\nrated by the air god who was born between them and is now lifting her up. Thus\na world space composed of air comes into being and inserts itself between earth\nand sky. See H. A. Frankfort, The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man\n(Chicago, 1946), p. 18, and Mircea Eliade, Traite d' Histone des Religions (Paris,\n1953), p. 212.\n\n\n[ 242 ]\n\n\nAction\n\n\nis, to the point of being always willing to forgive him whatever he\nmay have done, forgiving would have to remain altogether outside\nour considerations. Yet what love is in its own, narrowly circum-\nscribed sphere, respect is in the larger domain of human affairs.\nRespect, not unlike the Aristotelian philia politike, is a kind of\n“friendship” without intimacy and without closeness; it is a regard\nfor the person from the distance which the space of the world puts\nbetween us, and this regard is independent of qualities which we\nmay admire or of achievements which we may highly esteem.\nThus, the modern loss of respect, or rather the conviction that re-\nspect is due only where we admire or esteem, constitutes a clear\nsymptom of the increasing depersonalization of public and social\nlife. Respect, at any rate, because it concerns only the person, is\nquite sufficient to prompt forgiving of what a person did, for the\nsake of the person. But the fact that the same who, revealed in\naction and speech, remains also the subject of forgiving is the deep-\nest reason why nobody can forgive himself; here, as in action and\nspeech generally, we are dependent upon others, to whom we ap-\npear in a distinctness which we ourselves are unable to perceive.\nClosed within ourselves, we would never be able to forgive our-\nselves any failing or transgression because we would lack the ex-\nperience of the person for the sake of whom one can forgive.\n\n",
        "Section 34. UNPREDICTABILITY AND THE POWER OF PROMISE": "\nIn contrast to forgiving, which— perhaps because of its religious\ncontext, perhaps because of the connection with love attending its\ndiscovery — has always been deemed unrealistic and inadmissible\nin the public realm, the power of stabilization inherent in the fac-\nulty of making promises has been known throughout our tradition.\nWe may trace it back to the Roman legal system, the inviolability\nof agreements and treaties (pacta sunt servanda ) ; or we may see its\ndiscoverer in Abraham, the man from Ur, whose whole story, as\nthe Bible tells it, shows such a passionate drive toward making\ncovenants that it is as though he departed from his country for no\nother reason than to try out the power of mutual promise in the\n\nf 243 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwilderness of the world, until eventually God himself agreed to\nmake a Covenant with him. At any rate, the great variety of con-\ntract theories since the Romans attests to the fact that the power of\nmaking promises has occupied the center of political thought over\nthe centuries.\n\nThe unpredictability which the act of making promises at least\npartially dispels is of a twofold nature: it arises simultaneously out\nof the “darkness of the human heart,” that is, the basic unreliability\nof men who never can guarantee today who they will be tomorrow,\nand out of the impossibility of foretelling the consequences of an\nact within a community of equals where everybody has the same\ncapacity to act. Man's inability to rely upon himself or to have\ncomplete faith in himself (which is the same thing) is the price\nhuman beings pay for freedom; and the impossibility of remaining\nunique masters of what they do, of knowing its consequences and\nrelying upon the future, is the price they pay for plurality and\nreality, for the joy of inhabiting together with others a world\nwhose reality is guaranteed for each by the presence of all.\n\nThe function of the faculty of promising is to master this two-\nfold darkness of human affairs and is, as such, the only alternative\nto a mastery which relies on domination of one's self and rule over\nothers; it corresponds exactly to the existence of a freedom which\nwas given under the condition of non-sovereignty. The danger and\nthe advantage inherent in all bodies politic that rely on contracts\nand treaties is that they, unlike those that rely on rule and sov-\nereignty, leave the unpredictability of human affairs and the unre-\nliability of men as they are, using them merely as the medium, as\nit were, into which certain islands of predictability are thrown and\nin which certain guideposts of reliability are erected. The moment\npromises lose their character as isolated islands of certainty in an\nocean of uncertainty, that is, when this faculty is misused to cover\nthe whole ground of the future and to map out a path secured in all\ndirections, they lose their binding power and the whole enterprise\nbecomes self-defeating.\n\nWe mentioned before the power generated when people gather\ntogether and “act in concert,” which disappears the moment they\ndepart. The force that keeps them together, as distinguished from\nthe space of appearances in which they gather and the power which\n\n[ 244 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nkeeps this public space in existence, is the force of mutual promise\nor contract. Sovereignty, which is always spurious if claimed by an\nisolated single entity, be it the individual entity of the person or the\ncollective entity of a nation, assumes, in the case of many men\nmutually bound by promises, a certain limited reality. The sov-\nereignty resides in the resulting, limited independence from the\nincalculability of the future, and its limits are the same as those\ninherent in the faculty itself of making and keeping promises. The\nsovereignty of a body of people bound and kept together, not by an\nidentical will which somehow magically inspires them all, but by\nan agreed purpose for which alone the promises are valid and bind-\ning, shows itself quite clearly in its unquestioned superiority over\nthose who are completely free, unbound by any promises and\nunkept by any purpose. This superiority derives from the capacity\nto dispose of the future as though it were the present, that is, the\nenormous and truly miraculous enlargement of the very dimension\nin which power can be effective. Nietzsche, in his extraordinary\nsensibility to moral phenomena, and despite his modern prejudice\nto see the source of all power in the will power of the isolated indi-\nvidual, saw in the faculty of promises (the “memory of the will,” as\nhe called it) the very distinction which marks off human from ani-\nmal life . 83 If sovereignty is in the realm of action and human affairs\nwhat mastership is in the realm of making and the world of things,\nthen their chief distinction is that the one can only be achieved by\nthe many bound together, whereas the other is conceivable only in\nisolation.\n\nIn so far as morality is more than the sum total of mores , of cus-\ntoms and standards of behavior solidified through tradition and\nvalid on the ground of agreements, both of which change with\ntime, it has, at least politically, no more to support itself than the\ngood will to counter the enormous risks of action by readiness to\nforgive and to be forgiven, to make promises and to keep them.\n\n83. Nietzsche saw with unequaled clarity the connection between human\nsovereignty and the faculty of making promises, which led him to a unique insight\ninto the relatedness of human pride and human conscience. Unfortunately, both\ninsights remained unrelated with and without effect upon his chief concept, the\n“will to power,” and therefore are frequently overlooked even by Nietzsche\nscholars. They are to be found in the first two aphorisms of the second treatise in\nZur Genealogie der Moral.\n\n\n[ 245 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThese moral precepts are the only ones that are not applied to ac-\ntion from the outside, from some supposedly higher faculty or from\nexperiences outside action's own reach. They arise, on the con-\ntrary, directly out of the will to live together with others in the\nmode of acting and speaking, and thus they are like control mecha-\nnisms built into the very faculty to start new and unending proc-\nesses. If without action and speech, without the articulation of\nnatality, we would be doomed to swing forever in the ever-recur-\nring cycle of becoming, then without the faculty to undo what we\nhave done and to control at least partially the processes we have\nlet loose, we would be the victims of an automatic necessity bear-\ning all the marks of the inexorable laws which, according to the\nnatural sciences before our time, were supposed to constitute the\noutstanding characteristic of natural processes. We have seen be-\nfore that to mortal beings this natural fatality, though it swings in\nitself and may be eternal, can only spell doom. If it were true that\nfatality is the inalienable mark of historical processes, then it\nwould indeed be equally true that everything done in history is\ndoomed.\n\nAnd to a certain extent this is true. If left to themselves, human\naffairs can only follow the law of mortality, which is the most cer-\ntain and the only reliable law of a life spent between birth and\ndeath. It is the faculty of action that interferes with this law be-\ncause it interrupts the inexorable automatic course of daily life,\nwhich in its turn, as we saw, interrupted and interfered with the\ncycle of the biological life process. The life span of man running\ntoward death would inevitably carry everything human to ruin and\ndestruction if it were not for the faculty of interrupting it and be-\nginning something new, a faculty which is inherent in action like an\never-present reminder that men, though they must die, are not born\nin order to die but in order to begin. Yet just as, from the stand-\npoint of nature, the rectilinear movement of man's life-span be-\ntween birth and death looks like a peculiar deviation from the com-\nmon natural rule of cyclical movement, thus action, seen from the\nviewpoint of the automatic processes which seem to determine the\ncourse of the world, looks like a miracle. In the language of natural\nscience, it is the “infinite improbability which occurs regularly.”\nAction is, in fact, the one miracle-working faculty of man, as Jesus\n\n[ 246 1\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nof Nazareth, whose insights into this faculty can be compared in\ntheir originality and unprecedentedness with Socrates' insights into\nthe possibilities of thought, must have known very well when he\nlikened the power to forgive to the more general power of per-\nforming miracles, putting both on the same level and within the\nreach of man . 84\n\nThe miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs,\nfrom its normal, “natural” ruin is ultimately the tact of natality, in\nwhich the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. It is, in other\nwords, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they\nare capable of by virtue of being born. Only the full experience of\nthis capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope, those\ntwo essential characteristics of human existence which Greek\nantiquity ignored altogether, discounting the keeping of faith as a\nvery uncommon and not too important virtue and counting hope\namong the evils of illusion in Pandora's box. It is this faith in and\nhope for the world that found perhaps its most glorious and most\nsuccinct expression in the few words with which the Gospels\nannounced their “glad tidings”: “A child has been born unto us.”\n\n84. Cf. the quotations given in n. 77. Jesus himself saw the human root of this\npower to perform miracles in faith — which we leave out of our considerations.\nIn our context, the only point that matters is that the power to perform miracles is\nnot considered to be divine — faith will move mountains and faith will forgive; the\none is no less a miracle than the other, and the reply of the apostles when Jesus\ndemanded of them to forgive seven times in a day was: “Lord, increase our\nfaith.”\n\n\n[ 247 ]\n\n\n"

    "CHAPTER 6. The Vita A diva and the Modern Age": {
        "Section 35. WORLD ALIENATION": "\nThree great events stand at the threshold of the modern age and\ndetermine its character : the discovery of America and the ensuing\nexploration of the whole earth; the Reformation, which by ex-\npropriating ecclesiastical and monastic possessions started the two-\nfold process of individual expropriation and the accumulation of\nsocial wealth; the invention of the telescope and the development\nof a new science that considers the nature of the earth from the\nviewpoint of the universe. These cannot be called modern events\nas we know them since the French Revolution, and although they\ncannot be explained by any chain of causality, because no event\ncan, they are still happening in an unbroken continuity, in which\nprecedents exist and predecessors can be named. None of them\nexhibits the peculiar character of an explosion of undercurrents\nwhich, having gathered their force in the dark, suddenly erupt.\nThe names we connect with them, Galileo Galilei and Martin\nLuther and the great seafarers, explorers, and adventurers in the\nage of discovery, still belong to a premodern world. Moreover, the\nstrange pathos of novelty, the almost violent insistence of nearly\n\n[ 248 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nall the great authors, scientists, and philosophers since the seven-\nteenth century that they saw things never seen before, thought\nthoughts never thought before, can be found in none of them, not\neven in Galileo . 1 These precursors are not revolutionists, and their\nmotives and intentions are still securely rooted in tradition.\n\nIn the eyes of their contemporaries, the most spectacular of\nthese events must have been the discoveries of unheard-of con-\ntinents and undreamed-of oceans; the most disturbing might have\nbeen the Reformation's irremediable split of Western Christianity,\nwith its inherent challenge to orthodoxy as such and its immediate\nthreat to the tranquillity of men's souls; certainly the least noticed\nwas the addition of a new implement to man's already large arsenal\nof tools, useless except to look at the stars, even though it was the\nfirst purely scientific instrument ever devised. However, if we\ncould measure the momentum of history as we measure natural\nprocesses, we might find that what originally had the least notice-\nable impact, man's first tentative steps toward the discovery of the\nuniverse, has constantly increased in momentousness as well as\n\n1 . The term scienza nuova seems to occur for the first time in the work of the\nsixteenth-century Italian mathematician Niccolo Tartaglia, who designed the new\nscience of ballistics which he claimed to have discovered because he was the first\nto apply geometrical reasoning to the motion of projectiles. (I owe this informa-\ntion to Professor Alexandre Koyre.) Of greater relevance in our context is that\nGalileo, in the Sidereus Nuncius (1610), insists on the “absolute novelty” of his\ndiscoveries, but this certainly is a far cry from Hobbes s claim that political\nphilosophy was “no older than my own book De Cive” ( English Works , ed.\nMolesworth [1839], I, ix) or Descartes' conviction that no philosopher before\nhim had succeeded in philosophy (“Lettre au traducteur pouvant servir de\npreface” for Les principes de la philosophic ) . From the seventeenth century on, the\ninsistence on absolute novelty and the rejection of the whole tradition became\ncommonplace. Karl Jaspers ( Descartes und die Philosophic [2d ed.; 1948], pp.\n61 ff.) stresses the difference between Renaissance philosophy, where “Drang\nnach Gelrung der originalen Personlichkeit ... das Neusein als Auszeichnung\nverlangte,” and modem science, where “sich das Wort ‘neu' als sachliches\nWertpraedikat verbreitet.” In the same context, he shows how different in sig-\nnificance the claim to novelty is in science and philosophy. Descartes certainly\npresented his philosophy as a scientist may present a new scientific discovery.\nThus, he writes as follows about his “considerations”: “Jene merite point plus\nde gloire de les avoir trouvees, que ferait un passant d' avoir rencontre par bonheur\na ses pieds quelque riche tresor, que la diligence de plusieurs aurait inutilement\ncherche longtemps , auparavant” (La recherche de la verite [Pleiade ed.], p. 669).\n\n[ 249 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nspeed until it has eclipsed not only the enlargement of the earth's\nsurface, which found its final limitation only in the limitations of\nthe globe itself, but also the still apparently limitless economic\naccumulation process.\n\nBut these are mere speculations. As a matter of fact, the dis-\ncovery of the earth, the mapping of her lands and the chartering of\nher waters, took many centuries and has only now begun to come\nto an end. Only now has man taken full possession of his mortal\ndwelling place and gathered the infinite horizons, which were\ntemptingly and forbiddingly open to all previous ages, into a globe\nwhose majestic outlines and detailed surface he knows as he knows\nthe lines in the palm of his hand. Precisely when the immensity of\navailable space on earth was discovered, the famous shrinkage of\nthe globe began, until eventually in our world (which, though the\nresult of the modern age, is by no means identical with the modern\nage's world) each man is as much an inhabitant of the earth as he is\nan inhabitant of his country. Men now live in an earth-wide con-\ntinuous whole where even the notion of distance, still inherent in\nthe most perfectly unbroken contiguity of parts, has yielded before\nthe onslaught of speed. Speed has conquered space; and though this\nconquering process finds its limit at the unconquerable boundary of\nthe simultaneous presence of one body at two different places, it\nhas made distance meaningless, for no significant part of a human\nlife — years, months, or even weeks-~is any longer necessary to\nreach any point on the earth.\n\nNothing, to be sure, could have been more alien to the purpose of\nthe explorers and circumnavigators of the early modern age than\nthis closing-in process; they went to enlarge the earth, not shrink\nher into a ball, and when they submitted to the call of the distant,\nthey had no intention of abolishing distance. Only the wisdom of\nhindsight sees the obvious, that nothing can remain immense if it\ncan be measured, that every survey brings together distant parts\nand therefore establishes closeness where distance ruled before.\nThus the maps and navigation charts of the early stages of the\nmodern age anticipated the technical inventions through which all\nearthly space has become small and close at hand. Prior to the\nshrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,\nsteamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more\n\n[ 250 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\neffective shrinkage which comes about through the surveying ca-\npacity of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and\nmodels can condense and scale earthly physical distance down to\nthe size of the human body's natural sense and understanding.\nBefore we knew how to circle the earth, how to circumscribe the\nsphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had brought the\nglobe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and swirled\nbefore our eyes.\n\nThere is another aspect of this matter which, as we shall see,\nwill be of greater importance in our context. It is in the nature of\nthe human surveying capacity that it can function only if man dis-\nentangles himself from all involvement in and concern with the\nclose at hand and withdraws himself to a distance from everything\nnear him. The greater the distance between himself and his sur-\nroundings, world or earth, the more he will be able to survey and\nto measure and the less will worldly, earth-bound space be left to\nhim. The fact that the decisive shrinkage of the earth was the con-\nsequence of the invention of the airplane, that is, of leaving the\nsurface of the earth altogether, is like a symbol for the general\nphenomenon that any decrease of terrestrial distance can be won\nonly at the price of putting a decisive distance between man and\nearth, of alienating man from his immediate earthly surroundings.\n\nThe fact that the Reformation, an altogether different event,\neventually confronts us with a similar phenomenon of alienation,\nwhich Max Weber even identified, under the name of “innerworldly\nasceticism,” as the innermost spring of the new capitalist mental-\nity, may be one of the many coincidences that make it so difficult\nfor the historian not to believe in ghosts, demons, and Zeitgeists.\nWhat is so striking and disturbing is the similarity in utmost di-\nvergence. For this innerworldly alienation has nothing to do, either\nin intent or content, with the alienation from the earth inherent in\nthe discovery and taking possession of the earth. Moreover, the\ninnerworldly alienation whose historical factuality Max Weber\ndemonstrated in his famous essay is not only present in the new\nmorality that grew out of Luther's and Calvin's attempts to restore\nthe uncompromising otherworldliness of the Christian faith; it is\nequally present, albeit on an altogether different level, in the ex-\npropriation of the peasantry, which was the unforeseen conse-\n\n[ 251 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nquence of the expropriation of church property and, as such, the\ngreatest single factor in the breakdown of the feudal system . 2 It is,\nof course, idle to speculate on what the course of our economy\nwould have been without this event, whose impact propelled\nWestern mankind into a development in which all property was\ndestroyed in the process of its appropriation, all things devoured in\nthe process of their production, and the stability of the world\nundermined in a constant process of change. Yet, such speculations\nare meaningful to the extent that they remind us that history is a\nstory of events and not of forces or ideas with predictable courses.\nThey are idle and even dangerous when used as arguments against\nreality and when meant to point to positive potentialities and al-\nternatives, because their number is not only indefinite by definition\nbut they also lack the tangible unexpectedness of the event, and\ncompensate for it by mere plausibility. Thus, they remain sheer\nphantoms no matter in how pedestrian a manner they may be\npresented.\n\nIn order not to underestimate the momentum this process has\nreached after centuries of almost unhindered development, it may be\nwell to reflect on the so-called “economic miracle” of postwar\nGermany, a miracle only if seen in an outdated frame of reference.\nThe German example shows very clearly that under modern condi-\ntions the expropriation of people, the destruction of objects, and\nthe devastation of cities will turn out to be a radical stimulant for a\nprocess, not of mere recovery, but of quicker and more efficient\naccumulation of wealth — if only the country is modern enough to\nrespond in terms of the production process. In Germany, outright\ndestruction took the place of the relentless process of depreciation\nof all worldly things, which is the hallmark of the waste economy\n\n2. This is not to'deny the greatness of Max Weber's discovery of the enor-\nmous power that comes from an otherworldliness directed toward the world (see\n“Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism,” in Religionssoziologie [1920],\nVol. I). Weber finds the Protestant work ethos preceded by certain traits of\nmonastic ethics, and one can indeed see a first germ of these attitudes in Augus-\ntine's famous distinction between uti and frui, between the things of this world\nwhich one may use but not enjoy and those of the world to come which may be\nenjoyed for their own sake. The increase in power of man over the things of this\nworld springs in either case from the distance which man puts between himself\nand the world, that is, frpm world alienation.\n\n[ 2/2 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita A ctiva and the Modern Age\n\nin which we now live. The result is almost the same: a booming\nprosperity which, as postwar Germany illustrates, feeds not on the\nabundance of material goods or on anything stable and given but on\nthe process of production and consumption itself. Under modern\nconditions, not destruction but conservation spells ruin because the\nvery durability of conserved objects is the greatest impediment to\nthe turnover process, whose constant gain in speed is the only con-\nstancy left wherever it has taken hold . 3\n\nWe saw before that property, as distinguished from wealth and\nappropriation, indicates the privately owned share of a common\nworld and therefore is the most elementary political condition for\nman's worldliness. By the same token, expropriation and world\nalienation coincide, and the modern age, very much against the in-\ntentions of all the actors in the play, began by alienating certain\nstrata of the population from the world. We tend to overlook the\ncentral importance of this alienation for the modern age because we\nusually stress its secular character and identify the term secularity\nwith worldliness. Yet secularization as a tangible historical event\nmeans no more than separation of Church and State, of religion and\npolitics, and this, from a religious viewpoint, implies a return to\nthe early Christian attitude of “Render unto Caesar the things that\nare Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's” rather than a\nloss of faith and transcendence or a new and emphatic interest in\nthe things of this world.\n\nModern loss of faith is not religious in origin — it cannot be\ntraced to the Reformation and Counter Reformation, the two great\nreligious movements of the modern age — and its scope is by no\nmeans restricted to the religious sphere. Moreover, even if we ad-\nmitted that the modern age began with a sudden, inexplicable\n\n3. The reason most frequently given for the surprising recovery of Germany\n— that she did not have to carry the burden of a military budget — is inconclusive\non two accounts: first, Germany had to pay for a number of years the costs of\noccupation, which amounted to a sum almost equal to a full-fledged military\nbudget, and second, war production is held in other economies to be the greatest\nsingle factor in the postwar prosperity. Moreover, the point I wish to make could\nbe equally well illustrated by the common and yet quite uncanny phenomenom\nthat prosperity is closely connected with the “useless” production of means of\ndestruction, of goods produced to be wasted either by using them up in destruc-\ntion or — and this is the more common case — by destroying them because they\nsoon become obsolete.\n\n\n[ 253 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\neclipse of transcendence, of belief in a hereafter, it would by no\nmeans follow that this loss threw man back upon the world. The\nhistorical evidence, on the contrary, shows that modem men were\nnot thrown back upon this world but upon themselves. One of the\nmost persistent trends in modern philosophy since Descartes and\nperhaps its most original contribution to philosophy has been an\nexclusive concern with the self, as distinguished from the soul or\nperson or man in general, an attempt to reduce all experiences,\nwith the world as well as with other human beings, to experiences\nbetween man and himself. The greatness of Max Weber's dis-\ncovery about the origins of capitalism lay precisely in his demon-\nstration that an enormous, strictly mundane activity is possible\nwithout any care for or enjoyment of the world whatever, an ac-\ntivity whose deepest motivation, on the contrary, is worry and\ncare about the self. World alienation, and not self-alienation as\nMarx thought , 4 has been the hallmark of the modem age.\n\nExpropriation, the deprivation for certain groups of their place\n\n4. There are several indications in the writings of the young Marx that he\nwas not altogether unaware of the implications of world alienation in capitalist\neconomy. Thus, in the early article of 1842, “Debatten liber das Holzdiebstahls-\ngesetz” (see Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe [Berlin, 1932], Part I, Vol. I, pp.\n266 ff.), he criticizes a law against theft not only because the formal opposition\nof owner and thief leaves “human needs” out of account — the fact that the thief\nwho uses the wood needs it more urgently than the owner who sells it — and\ntherefore dehumanizes men by equating wood-user and wood-seller as wood pro-\nprietors, but also that the wood itself is deprived of its nature. A law which re-\ngards men only as property-owners considers things only as properties and prop-\nerties only as exchange objects, not as use things. That things are denatured when\nthey are used for exchange was probably suggested to Marx by Aristotle, who\npointed out that though a shoe may be wanted for either usage or exchange, it is\nagainst the nature of a shoe to be exchanged, “for a shoe is not made to be an\nobject of barter” {Politics 12J7a8). (Incidentally the influence of Aristotle on\nthe style of Marx's thought seems to me almost as characteristic and decisive as\nthe influence of Hegel's philosophy.) However, such occasional considerations\nplay a minor role in his work, which remained firmly rooted in the modem age's\nextreme subjectivism. In his ideal society, where men will produce as human\nbeings, world alienation is even more present than it was before; for then they\nwill be able to objectify (vergegenstdndlichen) their individuality, their peculiarity,\nto confirm and actualize their true being: “Unsere Produktionen waren ebenso-\nviele Spiegel, woraus unser Wesen sich entgegen leuchtete” (“Aus den Exzerp-\ntheften” [1844-45], in Gesamtausgabe, Part 1, Vol. Ill, pp. 546^47).\n\n[ 2S4 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modem Age\n\nin the world and their naked exposure to the exigencies of life,\ncreated both the original accumulation of wealth and the possibility\nof transforming this wealth into capital through labor. These to-\ngether constituted the conditions for the rise of a capitalist econ-\nomy. That this development, started by expropriation and fed upon\nit, would result in an enormous increase in human productivity was\nmanifest from the beginning, centuries before the industrial revolu-\ntion. The new laboring class, which literally lived from hand to\nmouth, stood not only directly under the compelling urgency of\nlife's necessity 5 but was at the same time alienated from all cares\nand worries which did not immediately follow from the life process\nitself. What was liberated in the early stages of the first free la-\nboring class in history was the force inherent in “labor power,”\nthat is, in the sheer natural abundance of the biological process,\nwhich like all natural forces — of procreation no less than of labor-\ning — provides for a generous surplus over and beyond the repro-\nduction of young to balance the old. What distinguishes this devel-\nopment at the beginning of the modern age from similar occur-\nrences in the past is that expropriation and wealth accumulation did\nnot simply result in new property or lead to a new redistribution of\nwealth, but were fed back into the process to generate further\nexpropriations, greater productivity, and more appropriation.\n\nIn other words, the liberation of labor power as a natural process\ndid not remain restricted to certain classes of society, and ap-\npropriation did not come to an end with the satisfaction of wants\nand desires; capital accumulation, therefore, did not lead to the\nstagnation we know so well from rich empires prior to the modern\nage, but spread throughout the society and initiated a steadily in-\ncreasing flow of wealth. But this process, which indeed is the “life\nprocess of society,” as Marx used to call it, and whose wealth-\nproducing capacity can be compared only with the fertility of natu-\nral processes where the creation of one man and one woman would\nsuffice to produce by multiplication any given number of human\nbeings, remains bound to the principle of world alienation from\n\n5. This of course is markedly different from present conditions, where the\nday laborer has already become a weekly wage-earner; in a probably not very\ndistant future the guaranteed annual wage will do away with these early condi-\ntions altogether.\n\n\n[ 255 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwhich it sprang; the process can continue only provided that no\nworldly durability and stability is permitted to interfere, only as\nlong as all worldly things, all end products of the production proc-\ness, are fed back into it at an ever-increasing speed. In other words,\nthe process of wealth accumulation, as we know it, stimulated by\nthe life process and in turn stimulating human life, is possible only\nif the world and the very worldliness of man are sacrificed.\n\nThe first stage of this alienation was marked by its cruelty, the\nmisery and material wretchedness it meant for a steadily increasing\nnumber of “labouring poor,” whom expropriation deprived of the\ntwofold protection of family and property, that is, of a family-\nowned private share in the world, which until the modern age had\nhoused the individual life process and the laboring activity subject\nto its necessities. The second stage was reached when society be-\ncame the subject of the new life process, as the family had been its\nsubject before. Membership in a social class replaced the protection\npreviously offered by membership in a family, and social solidarity\nbecame a very efficient substitute for the earlier, natural solidarity\nruling the family unit. Moreover, society as a whole, the “collec-\ntive subject” of the life process, by no means remained an in-\ntangible entity, the “communist fiction” needed by classical eco-\nnomics; just as the family unit had been identified with a privately\nowned piece of the world, its property, society was identified with\na tangible, albeit collectively owned, piece of property, the terri-\ntory of the nation-state, which until its decline in the twentieth\ncentury offered all classes a substitute for the privately owned\nhome of which the class of the poor had been deprived.\n\nThe organic theories of nationalism, especially in its Central\nEuropean version, all rest on an identification of the nation and the\nrelationships between its members with the family and family rela-\ntionships. Because society becomes the substitute for the family,\n“blood and soil” is supposed to rule the relationships between its\nmembers; homogeneity of population and its rootedness in the soil\nof a given territory become the requisites for the nation-state ev-\nerywhere. However, while this development undoubtedly miti-\ngated cruelty and misery, it hardly influenced the process of ex-\npropriation and world alienation, since collective ownership,\nstrictly speaking, is a contradiction in terms.\n\n[ 256 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nThe decline of the European nation-state system; the economic\nand geographic shrinkage of the earth, so that prosperity and de-\npression tend to become world-wide phenomena; the transforma-\ntion of mankind, which until our own time was an abstract notion\nor a guiding principle for humanists only, into a really existing\nentity whose members at the most distant points of the globe need\nless time to meet than the members of a nation needed a generation\nago — these mark the beginnings of the last stage in this develop-\nment. Just as the family and its property were replaced by class\nmembership and national territory, so mankind now begins to re-\nplace nationally bound societies, and the earth replaces the limited\nstate territory. But whatever the future may bring, the process of\nworld alienation, started by expropriation and characterized by an\never-increasing progress in wealth, can only assume even more\nradical proportions if it is permitted to follow its own inherent law.\nFor men cannot become citizens of the world as they are citizens of\ntheir countries, and social men cannot own collectively as family\nand household men own their private property. The rise of society\nbrought about the simultaneous decline of the public as well as the\nprivate realm. But the eclipse of a common public world, so crucial\nto the formation of the lonely mass man and so dangerous in the\nformation of the worldless mentality of modern ideological mass\nmovements, began with the much more tangible loss of a privately\nowned share in the world.\n\n",
        "Section 36. THE DISCOVERY OF THE ARCHIMEDEAN POINT": "\n“Since a babe was born in a manger, it may be doubted whether so\ngreat a thing has happened with so little stir.” These are the words\nwith which Whitehead introduces Galileo and the discovery of the\ntelescope on the stage of the “modem world .” 6 Nothing in these\nwords is an exaggeration. Like the birth in a manger, which\nspelled not the end of antiquity but the beginning of something so\nunexpectedly and unpredictably new that neither hope nor fear\ncould have anticipated it, these first tentative glances into the uni-\n6.

Except for the numerically small, politically in-\nconsequential milieu of learned men- — astronomers, philosophers,\nand theologians— the telescope created no great excitement; public\nattention was drawn, rather, to Galileo's dramatic demonstration\nof the laws of falling bodies, taken to be the beginning of modern\nnatural science (although it may be doubted that by themselves,\nwithout being transformed later by Newton into the universal law\nof gravitation — still one of the most grandiose examples of the\nmodern amalgamation of astronomy and physics — they would ever\nhave led the new science on the path of astrophysics) . For what\nmost drastically distinguished the new world view not only from\nthat of antiquity or the Middle Ages, but from the great thirst for\ndirect experience in the Renaissance as well, was the assumption\nthat the same kind of exterior force should be manifest in the fall of\nterrestrial and the movements of heavenly bodies.\n\nMoreover, the novelty of Galileo's discovery was clouded by\nits close relationship to antecedents and predecessors. Not the\nphilosophical speculations of Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno\nalone, but the mathematically trained imagination of the astrono-\nmers, Copernicus and Kepler, had challenged the finite, geocentric\nworld view which men had held since time immemorial. Not\nGalileo but the philosophers were the first to abolish the dichotomy\nbetween one earth and one sky above it, promoting, as they\nthought, the earth “to the rank of the noble stars” and finding her a\nhome in an eternal and infinite universe . 7 And it seems the as-\ntronomers needed no telescope to assert that, contrary to all sense\nexperience, it is not the sun that moves around the earth but the\nearth that circles the sun. If the historian looks back upon these\nbeginnings with all the wisdom and prejudices of hindsight, he is\ntempted to conclude that no empirical confirmation was needed to\nabolish the Ptolemaic system. What was wanted was, rather, the\n\n7. I follow the excellent recent exposition of the interrelated history of philo-\nsophic and scientific thought in “the seventeenth century revolution” by Alexan-\ndre Koyre ( From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe [1957], pp. 43 ff.).\n\n[ 2S8 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nspeculative courage to follow the ancient and medieval principle of\nsimplicity in nature — even if it led to the denial of all sense experi-\nence — and the great boldness of Copernicus' imagination, which\nlifted him from the earth and enabled him to look down upon her as\nthough he actually were an inhabitant of the sun. And the historian\nfeels justified in his conclusions when he considers that Galileo's\ndiscoveries were preceded by a “veritable retour a Archimede”\nwhich had been effective since the Renaissance. It certainly is sug-\ngestive that Leonardo studied him with passionate interest and\nthat Galileo can be called his disciple . 8\n\nHowever, neither the speculations of philosophers nor the im-\naginings of astronomers has ever constituted an event. Prior to\nthe telescopic discoveries of Galileo, Giordano Bruno's philosophy\nattracted little attention even among learned men, and without the\nfactual confirmation they bestowed upon the Copernican revolu-\ntion, not only the theologians but all “sensible men . . . would\nhave pronounced it a wild appeal ... of an uncontrolled imagina-\ntion .” 9 In the realm of ideas there are only originality and depth,\nboth personal qualities, but no absolute, objective novelty; ideas\ncome and go, they have a permanence, even an immortality of their\nown, depending upon their inherent power of illumination, which\nis and endures independently of time and history. Ideas, moreover,\nas distinguished from events, are never unprecedented, and em-\npirically unconfirmed speculations about the earth's movement\naround the sun were no more unprecedented than contemporary\ntheories about atoms would be if they had no basis in experiments\nand no consequences in the factual world . 10 What Galileo did and\nwhat nobody had done before was to use the telescope in such a\n\n8.

The first “to save the phenomena by the assumption that the heaven is at\nrest, but that the earth revolves in an oblique orbit, while also rotating about its\nown axis” was Aristarchus of Samos in the third century b.c., and the first to\nconceive of an atomic structure of matter was Democritus of Abdera in the fifth\ncentury b.c. A very instructive account of the Greek physical world from the\nviewpoint of modern science is given by S. Sambursky, The Physical World of the\nGreeks (1956).\n\n\n[ 259 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nway that the secrets of the universe were delivered to human cogni-\ntion “with the certainty of sense-perception ”; 11 that is, he put\nwithin the grasp of an earth-bound creature and its body-bound\nsenses what had seemed forever beyond his reach, at best open to\nthe uncertainties of speculation and imagination.\n\nThis difference in relevance between the Copernican system and\nGalileo's discoveries was quite clearly understood by the Catholic\nChurch, which raised no objections to the pre-Galilean theory of\nan immobile sun and a moving earth as long as the astronomers\nused it as a convenient hypothesis for mathematical purposes; but,\nas Cardinal Bellarmine pointed out to Galileo, “to prove that the\nhypothesis . . . saves the appearances is not at all the same thing as\nto demonstrate the reality of the movement of the earth .” 12 How\npertinent this remark was could be seen immediately by the sudden\nchange of mood which overtook the learned world after the con-\nfirmation of Galileo's discovery. From then on, the enthusiasm\nwith which Giordano Bruno had conceived of an infinite universe,\nand the pious exultation with which Kepler had contemplated the\nsun, “the most excellent of all the bodies in the universe whose\nwhole essence is nothing but pure light” and which therefore was\nto him the most fitting dwelling place of “God and the blessed\nangels ,” 13 or the more sober satisfaction of Nicholas of Cusa of see-\ning the earth finally at home in the starred sky, were conspicuous\nby their absence. By “confirming” his predecessors, Galileo estab-\nlished a demonstrable fact where before him there were inspired\nspeculations. The immediate philosophic reaction to this reality\nwas not exultation but the Cartesian doubt by which modern\nphilosophy — that “school of suspicion,” as Nietzsche once called\n\n11. Galileo {op. cit.) himself stressed this point: “Any one can know with the\ncertainty of sense-perception that the moon is by no means endowed with a\nsmooth and polished surface, etc.” (quoted from Koyre, op. cit., p. 89) .\n\n12. A similar stand was taken by the Lutheran theologian Osiander of Nurem-\nberg, who wrote in an introduction to Copernicus' posthumous work, On the\nRevolutions of Celestial Bodies (1 546) : “The hypotheses of this book are not neces-\nsarily true or even probable. Only one thing matters. They must lead by com-\nputation to results that are in agreement with the observed phenomena.” Both\nquotations are from Philipp Frank, “Philosophical Uses of Science,” Bulletin of\nAtomic Scientists, Vol. XIII, No. 4 (April, 1957).\n\n13. Burtt, op. cit., p. 58.\n\n\n[ 260 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nit— was founded, and which ended in the conviction that “only on\nthe firm foundation of unyielding despair can the soul's habitation\nhenceforth be safely built .” 14\n\nFor many centuries the consequences of this event, again not\nunlike the consequences of the Nativity, remained contradictory\nand inconclusive, and even today the conflict between the event\nitself and its almost immediate consequences is far from resolved.\nThe rise of the natural sciences is credited with a demonstrable,\never -quickening increase inhuman knowledge and power; shortly\nbefore the modern age European mankind knew less than Archi-\nmedes in the third century b.c., while the first fifty years of our\ncentury have witnessed more important discoveries than all the\ncenturies of recorded history together. Yet the same phenomenon\nis blamed with equal right for the hardly less demonstrable in-\ncrease in human despair or the specifically modern nihilism which\nhas spread to ever larger sections of the population, their most sig-\nnificant aspect perhaps being that they no longer spare the scien-\ntists themselves, whose well-founded optimism could still, in the\nnineteenth century, stand up against the equally justifiable pessi-\nmism of thinkers and poets. The modern astrophysical world view,\nwhich began with Galileo, and its challenge to the adequacy of the\nsenses to reveal reality, have left us a universe of whose qualities\nwe know no more than the way they affect our measuring instru-\nments, and — in the words of Eddington — “the former have as much\nresemblance to the latter as a telephone number has to a sub-\nscriber .” 15 Instead of objective qualities, in other words, we find\ninstruments, and instead of nature or the universe — in the words of\nHeisenberg — man encounters only himself . 16\n\n14. Bertrand Russell, “A Free Man's Worship,” in Mysticism and Logic\n(1918), p. 46.\n\n1 5 . As quoted by J. W. N. Sullivan, Limitations of Science (Mentor ed.) , p, 141 .\n\n16. The German physicist Werner Heisenberg has expressed this thought in a\nnumber of recent publications. For instance: “Wenn man versucht, von der Situa-\ntion in der modernen Naturwissenschaft ausgehend, sich zu den in Bewegung\ngeratenen Fundamenten vorzutasten, so hat man den Eindruck, . . . dass zum\nerstenmal im Laufe der Geschichte der Mensch auf dieser Erde nur noch sich\nselbst gegeniibersteht . . . , dass wir gewissermassen immer nur uns selbst be-\ngegnen” ( Das Naturbild der heutigen Physik [1955], pp. 17-18). Heisenberg's\npoint is that the observed object has no existence independent of the observing\n\n[ 261 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe point, in our context, is that both despair and triumph are\ninherent in the same event. If we wish to put this into historical\nperspective, it is as if Galileo's discovery proved in demonstrable\nfact that both the worst fear and the most presumptuous hope of\nhuman speculation, the ancient fear that our senses, our very or-\ngans for the reception of reality, might betray us, and the Archi-\nmedean wish for a point outside the earth from which to unhinge\nthe world, could only come true together, as though the wish\nwould be granted only provided that we lost reality and the fear\nwas to be consummated only if compensated by the acquisition of\nsupramundane powers. For whatever we do today in physics—\nwhether we release energy processes that ordinarily go on only in\nthe sun, or attempt to initiate in a test tube the processes of cosmic\nevolution, or penetrate with the help of telescopes the cosmic\nspace to a limit of two and even six billion light years, or build\nmachines for the production and control of energies unknown in\nthe household of earthly nature, or attain speeds in atomic accelera-\ntors which approach the speed of light, or produce elements not to\nbe found in nature, or disperse radioactive particles, created by us\nthrough the use of cosmic radiation, on the earth — we always\nhandle nature from a point in the universe outside the earth. With-\nout actually standing where Archimedes wished to stand ( dos moi\npou sto), still bound to the earth through the human condition, we\nhave found a way to act on the earth and within terrestrial nature\nas though we dispose of it from outside, from the Archimedean\npoint. And even at the risk of endangering the natural life process\nwe expose the earth to universal, cosmic forces alien to nature's\nhousehold.\n\nWhile these achievements were anticipated by no one, and while\nmost present-day theories flatly contradict those formulated during\nthe first centuries of the modern age, this development itself was\npossible only because at the beginning the old dichotomy between\nearth and sky was abolished and a unification of the universe ef-\nfected, so that from then on nothing occurring in earthly nature\n\nsubject: “Durch die Art der Beobachtung wird entschieden, welche Zuge der\nNatur bestimmt werden und welche wir durch unsere Beobachtungen ver-\nwischen” ( Wandlungen in den Grundlagen der Naturwissenschaft [1949], p. 67).\n\n[ 262 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nwas viewed as a mere earthly happening. All events were consid-\nered to be subject to a universally valid law in the fullest sense of\nthe word, which means, among other things, valid beyond the\nreach of human sense experience (even of the sense experiences\nmade with the help of the finest instruments), valid beyond the\nreach of human memory and the appearance of mankind on earth,\nvalid even beyond the coming into existence of organic life and the\nearth herself. All laws of the new astrophysical science are formu-\nlated from the Archimedean point, and this point probably lies\nmuch farther away from the earth and exerts much more power\nover her than Archimedes or Galileo ever dared to think.\n\nIf scientists today point out that we may assume with equal\nvalidity that the earth turns around the sun or the sun turns around\nthe earth, that both assumptions are in agreement with observed\nphenomena and the difference is only a difference of the chosen\npoint of reference, it by no means indicates a return to Cardinal\nBellarmine's or Copernicus' position, where the astronomers dealt\nwith mere hypotheses. It rather signifies that we have moved the\nArchimedean point one step farther away from the earth to a point\nin the universe where neither earth nor sun are centers of a uni-\nversal system. It means that we no longer feel bound even to the\nsun, that we move freely in the universe, choosing our point of\nreference wherever it may be convenient for a specific purpose.\nFor the actual accomplishments of modem science this change\nfrom the earlier heliocentric system to a system without a fixed\ncenter is, no doubt, as important as the original shift from the geo-\ncentric to the heliocentric world view. Only now have we estab-\nlished ourselves as “universal” beings, as creatures who are ter-\nrestrial not by nature and essence but only by the condition of\nbeing alive, and who therefore by virtue of reasoning can overcome\nthis condition not in mere speculation but in actual fact. Yet the\ngeneral relativism that results automatically from the shift from a\nheliocentric to a centerless world view — conceptualized in Ein-\nstein's theory of relativity with its denial that “at a definite present\ninstant all matter is simultaneously real ” 17 and the concomitant,\nimplied denial that Being which appears in time and space pos-\nsesses an absolute reality — was already contained in, or at least\n\n17. Whitehead, op. cit., p. 120.\n\n[ 263 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\npreceded by, those seventeenth-century theories according to\nwhich blue is nothing but a “relation to a seeing eye” and heaviness\nnothing but a “relation of reciprocal acceleration .” 18 The parentage\nof modern relativism is not in Einstein but in Galileo and Newton.\n\nWhat ushered in the modern age was not the age-old desire of\nastronomers for simplicity, harmony, and beauty, which made\nCopernicus look upon the orbits of the planets from the sun instead\nof the earth, nor the Renaissance's new-awakened love for the\nearth and the world, with its rebellion against the rationalism of\nmedieval scholasticism; this love of the world, on the contrary,\nwas the first to fall victim to the modern age's triumphal world\nalienation. It was rather the discovery, due to the new instrument,\nthat Copernicus' image of “the virile man standing in the sun . . .\noverlooking the planets ” 19 was much more than an image or a ges-\nture, was in fact an indication of the astounding human capacity to\nthink in terms of the universe while remaining on the earth, and the\nperhaps even more astounding human ability to use cosmic laws as\nguiding principles for terrestrial action. Compared with the earth\nalienation underlying the whole development of natural science in\nthe modern age, the withdrawal from terrestrial proximity con-\ntained in the discovery of the globe as a whole and the world aliena-\ntion produced in the twofold process of expropriation and wealth\naccumulation are of minor significance.\n\nAt any event, while world alienation determined the course and\nthe development of modern society, earth alienation became and\nhas remained the hallmark of modern science. Under the sign of\nearth alienation, every science, not only physical and natural sci-\nence, so radically changed its innermost content that one may\ndoubt whether prior to the modern age anything like science ex-\nisted at all. This is perhaps clearest in the development of the new\nscience's most important mental instrument, the devices of modern\nalgebra, by which mathematics “succeeded in freeing itself from\n\n18. Ernst Cassirer's early essay, Einstein's Theory of Relativity (Dover Publi-\ncations, 1953), strongly emphasizes this continuity between twentieth-century\nand seventeenth-century science.\n\n19. J. Bronowski, in an article “Science and Human Values,” points out the\ngreat role the metaphor played in the mind of important scientists (see Nation,\nDecember 29, 1956).\n\n[ 264 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthe shackles of spatiality ,” 20 that is, from geometry, which, as the\nname indicates, depends on terrestrial measures and measurements.\nModern mathematics freed man from the shackles of earth-bound\nexperience and his power of cognition from the shackles of finitude.\n\nThe decisive point here is not that men at the beginning of the\nmodern age still believed with Plato in the mathematical structure\nof the universe nor that, one generation later, they believed with\nDescartes that certain knowledge is possible only where the mind\nplays with its own forms and formulas. What is decisive is the\nentirely un-Platonic subjection of geometry to algebraic treat-\nment, which discloses the modern ideal of reducing terrestrial\nsense data and movements to mathematical symbols. Without this\nnon-spatial symbolic language Newton would not have been able\nto unite astronomy and physics into a single science or, to put it\nanother way, to formulate a law of gravitation where the same\nequation will cover the movements of heavenly bodies in the sky\nand the motion of terrestrial bodies on earth. Even then it was clear\nthat modern mathematics, in an already breathtaking development,\nhad discovered the amazing human faculty to grasp in symbols\nthose dimensions and concepts which at most had been thought of\nas negations and hence limitations of the mind, because their im-\nmensity seemed to transcend the minds of mere mortals, whose\nexistence lasts an insignificant time and remains bound to a not too\nimportant corner of the universe. Yet even more significant than\nthis possibility — to reckon with entities which could not be “seen”\nby the eye of the mind — was the fact that the new mental instru-\nment, in this respect even newer and more significant than all the\nscientific tools it helped to devise, opened the way for an alto-\ngether novel mode of meeting and approaching nature in the ex-\nperiment. In the experiment man realized his newly won freedom\nfrom the shackles of earth-bound experience; instead of observing\nnatural phenomena as they were given to him, he placed nature\nunder the conditions of his own mind, that is, under conditions won\nfrom a universal, astrophysical viewpoint, a cosmic standpoint\noutside nature itself.\n\nIt is for this reason that mathematics became the leading science\nof the modern age, and this elevation has nothing to do with Plato,\n\n20. Burtt, op. cit., p. 44.\n\n\n[ 265 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nwho deemed mathematics to be the noblest of all sciences, second\nonly to philosophy, which he thought nobody should be permitted\nto approach without having become familiar first with the mathe-\nmatical world of ideal forms. For mathematics (that is, geometry)\nwas the proper introduction to that sky of ideas where no mere im-\nages ( eidola ) and shadows, no perishable matter, could any longer\ninterfere with the appearing of eternal being, where these appear-\nances are saved (sozein ta phainomena) and safe, as purified of hu-\nman sensuality and mortality as of material perishability. Yet\nmathematical and ideal forms were not the products of the intel-\nlect, but given to the eyes of the mind as sense data were given to\nthe organs of the senses; and those who were trained to perceive\nwhat was hidden from the eyes of bodily vision and the untrained\nmind of the many perceived true being, or rather being in its true\nappearance. With the rise of modernity, mathematics does not\nsimply enlarge its content or reach out into the infinite to become\napplicable to the immensity of an infinite and infinitely growing,\nexpanding universe, but ceases to be concerned with appearances at\nall. It is no longer the beginning of philosophy, of the “science” of\nBeing in its true appearance, but becomes instead the science of the\nstructure of the human mind.\n\nWhen Descartes' analytical geometry treated space and exten-\nsion, the res extensa of nature and the world, so “that its relations,\nhowever complicated, must always be expressible in algebraic\nformulae,” mathematics succeeded in reducing and translating all\nthat man is not into patterns which are identical with human,\nmental structures. When, moreover, the same analytical geometry\nproved “conversely that numerical truths . . . can be fully repre-\nsented spatially,” a physical science had been evolved which re-\nquired no principles for its completion beyond those of pure mathe-\nmatics, and in this science man could move, risk himself into space\nand be certain that he would not encounter anything but himself,\nnothing that could not be reduced to patterns present in him . 31 Now\nthe phenomena could be saved only in so far as they could be re-\nduced to a mathematical order, and this mathematical operation\ndoes not serve to prepare man's mind for the revelation of true\nbeing by directing it to the ideal measures that appear in the\n\n21. Ibid., p. 106.\n\n[ 266 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n\nsensually given data, but serves, on the contrary, to reduce these\ndata to the measure of the human mind, which, given enough dis-\ntance, being sufficiently remote and uninvolved, can look upon and\nhandle the multitude and variety of the concrete in accordance with\nits own patterns and symbols. These are no longer ideal forms dis-\nclosed to the eye of the mind, but are the results of removing the\neyes of the mind, no less than the eyes of the body, from the phe-\nnomena, of reducing all appearances through the force inherent in\ndistance.\n\nUnder this condition of remoteness, every assemblage of things\nis transformed into a mere multitude, and every multitude, no\nmatter how disordered, incoherent, and confused, will fall into\ncertain patterns and configurations possessing the same validity\nand no more significance than the mathematical curve, which, as\nLeibniz once remarked, can always be found between points\nthrown at random on a piece of paper. For if “it can be shown that\na mathematical web of some kind can be woven about any universe\ncontaining several objects . . . then the fact that our universe lends\nitself to mathematical treatment is not a fact of any great philo-\nsophic significance .” 22 It certainly is neither a demonstration of an\ninherent and inherently beautiful order of nature nor does it offer a\nconfirmation of the human mind, of its capacity to surpass the\nsenses in perceptivity or of its adequateness as an organ for the\nreception of truth.\n\nThe modern reductio scientiae ad mathematicam has overruled the\ntestimony of nature as witnessed at close range by human senses in\nthe same way that Leibniz overruled the knowledge of the hap-\nhazard origin and the chaotic nature of the dot-covered piece of\npaper. And the feeling of suspicion, outrage, and despair, which\nwas the first, and spiritually is still the most lasting consequence of\nthe discovery that the ‘Archimedean point was no vain dream of\nidle speculation, is not unlike the helpless outrage of a man who,\n\n22. Bertrand Russell, as quoted by J. W. N. Sullivan, op. cit., p. 144. See\nalso Whitehead's distinction between the traditional scientific method of classi-\nfication and the modern approach of measurement: the former follows objective\nrealities whose principle is found in the otherness of nature; the latter is entirely\nsubjective, independent of qualities, and requires not more than that a multitude\nof objects be given.\n\n[ 267 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nhaving watched with his own eyes how these dots were thrown\narbitrarily and without foresight onto the paper, is shown and\nforced to admit that all his senses and all his powers of judgment\nhave betrayed him and that what he saw was the evolution of a\n“geometrical line whose direction is constantly and uniformly\ndefined by one rule .” 23\n\n",
        "Section 37. UNIVERSAL VERSUS NATURAL SCIENCE": "\nIt took many generations and quite a few centuries before the true\nmeaning of the Copernican revolution and the discovery of the\nArchimedean point came to light. Only we, and we only for hardly\nmore than a few decades, have come to live in a world thoroughly\ndetermined by a science and a technology whose objective truth\nand practical know-how are derived from cosmic and universal, as\ndistinguished from terrestrial and “natural,” laws, and in which a\nknowledge acquired by selecting a point of reference outside the\nearth is applied to earthly nature and the human artifice. There is a\ndeep gulf between those before us who knew that the earth re-\nvolves around the sun, that neither the one nor the other is the cen-\nter of the universe, and who concluded that man had lost his home\nas well as his privileged position in creation, and ourselves, who\nstill and probably forever are earth-bound creatures, dependent\nupon metabolism with a terrestrial nature, and who have found the\nmeans to bring about processes of cosmic origin and possibly\ncosmic dimension. If one wishes to draw a distinctive line between\nthe modern age and the world we have come to live in, he may. well\nfind it in the difference between a science which looks upon nature\nfrom a universal standpoint and thus acquires complete mastery\nover her, on one hand, and a truly “universal” science, on the\nother, which imports cosmic processes into nature even at the ob-\nvious risk of destroying her and, with her, man's mastership over\nher.\n\nForemost in our minds at this moment is of course the enor-\nmously increased human power of destruction, that we are able to\n\n23. Leibniz, Discours de metaphysique, No. 6.\n\n[ 268 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modem Age\n\n\ndestroy all organic life on earth and shall probably be able one day\nto destroy even the earth itself. However, no less awesome and no\nless difficult to come to terms with is the corresponding new crea-\ntive power, that we can produce new elements never found in\nnature, that we are able not only to speculate about the relation-\nships between mass and energy and their innermost identity but\nactually to transform mass into energy or to transform radiation\ninto matter. At the same time, we have begun to populate the space\nsurrounding the earth with man-made stars, creating as it were, in\nthe form of satellites, new heavenly bodies, and we hope that in a\nnot very distant future we shall be able to perform what times before\nus regarded as the greatest, the deepest, and holiest secret of na-\nture, to create or re-create the miracle of life. I use the word “cre-\nate” deliberately, to indicate that we are actually doing what all\nages before ours thought to be the exclusive prerogative of divine\naction.\n\nThis thought strikes us as blasphemous, and though it is blasphe-\nmous in every traditional Western or Eastern philosophic or theo-\nlogical frame of reference, it is no more blasphemous than what we\nhave been doing and what we are aspiring to do. The thought loses\nits blasphemous character, however, as soon as we understand\nwhat Archimedes understood so well, even though he did not know\nhow to reach his point outside the earth, namely, that no matter\nhow we explain the evolution of the earth and nature and man, they\nmust have come into being by some transmundane, “universal”\nforce, whose work must be comprehensible to the point of imita-\ntion by somebody who is able to occupy the same location. It is\nultimately nothing but this assumed location in the universe out-\nside the earth that enables us to produce processes which do not\noccur on the earth and play no role in stable matter but are decisive\nfor the coming into being of matter. It is indeed in the very nature\nof the thing that astrophysics and not geophysics, that “universal”\nscience and not “natural” science, should have been able to pene-\ntrate the last secrets of the earth and of nature. From the viewpoint\nof the universe, the earth is but a special case and can be under-\nstood as such, just as in this view there cannot be a decisive distinc-\n\n[ 269 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntion between matter and energy, both being “only different forms\nof the selfsame basic substance .” 24\n\nWith Galileo already, certainly since Newton, the word “uni-\nversal” has begun to acquire a very specific meaning indeed; it\nmeans “valid beyond our solar system.” And something quite\nsimilar has happened to another word of philosophic origin, the\nword “absolute,” which is applied to “absolute time,” “absolute\nspace,” “absolute motion,” or “absolute speed,” in each usage\nmeaning a time, a space, a movement, a velocity which is present\nin the universe and compared to which earth-bound time or space\nor movement or speed are only “relative.” Everything happening\non earth has become relative since the earth's relatedness to the\nuniverse became the point of reference for all measurements.\n\nPhilosophically, it seems that man's ability to take this cosmic,\nuniversal standpoint without changing his location is the clearest\npossible indication of his universal origin, as it were. It is as though\nwe no longer needed theology to tell us that man is not, cannot\npossibly be, of this world even though he spends his life here; and\nwe may one day be able to look upon the age-old enthusiasm of\nphilosophers for the universal as the first indication, as though they\nalone possessed a foreboding, that the time would come when men\nwould have to live under the earth's conditions and at the same\ntime be able to look upon and act on her from a point outside. (The\ntrouble is only — or so it seems now — that while man can do things\nfrom a “universal,” absolute standpoint, what the philosophers had\nnever deemed possible, he has lost his capacity to think in universal,\nabsolute terms, thus realizing and defeating at the same time the\nstandards and ideals of traditional philosophy. Instead of the old\ndichotomy between earth and sky we have a new one between man\nand the universe, or between the capacities of the human mind for\nunderstanding and the universal laws which man can discover and\nhandle without true comprehension.) Whatever the rewards and\nthe burdens of this yet uncertain future may turn out to be, one\nthing is sure: while it may affect greatly, perhaps even radically,\nthe vocabulary and metaphoric content of existing religions, it\n\n24. I follow the presentation given by Werner Heisenberg, “Elementarteile\nder Materie,” in Vom Atom zum Weltsystem (1954).\n\n[ 270 }\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nneither abolishes nor removes nor even shifts the unknown that is\nthe region of faith.\n\nWhile the new science, the science of the Archimedean point,\nneeded centuries and generations to develop its full potentialities,\ntaking roughly two hundred years before it even began to change\nthe world and to establish new conditions for the life of man, it\ntook no more than a few decades, hardly one generation, for the\nhuman mind to draw certain conclusions from Galileo's discoveries\nand the methods and assumption by which they had been accom-\nplished. The human mind changed in a matter of years or decades\nas radically as the human world in a matter of centuries; and while\nthis change naturally remained restricted to the few who belonged\nto that strangest of all modern societies, the society of scientists\nand the republic of letters (the only society which has survived all\nchanges of conviction and conflict without a revolution and without\never forgetting to “honor the man whose beliefs it no longer\nshares ”), 26 this society anticipated in many respects, by sheer force\nof trained and controlled imagination, the radical change of mind of\nall modern men which became a politically demonstrable reality\nonly in our own time . 26 Descartes is no less the father of modern\n\n25. Bronowski, op. cit.\n\n26. The foundation and early history of the Royal Society is quite suggestive.\nWhen it was founded, members had to agree to take no part in matters outside the\nterms of reference given it by the King, especially to take no part in political or\nreligious strife. One is tempted to conclude that the modern scientific ideal of\n“objectivity” was born here, which would suggest that its origin is political and\nnot scientific. Furthermore, it seems noteworthy that the scientists found it neces-\nsary from the beginning to organize themselves into a society, and the fact that\nthe work done inside the Royal Society turned out to be vastly more important\nthan work done outside it demonstrated how right they were. An organization,\nwhether of scientists who have abjured politics or of politicians, is always a\npolitical institution; where men organize they intend to act and to acquire power.\nNo scientific teamwork is pure science, whether its aim is to act upon society and\nsecure its members a certain position within it or — as was and still is to a large\nextent the case of organized research in the natural sciences — to act together and\nin concert in order to conquer nature. It is indeed, as Whitehead once remarked,\n“no accident that an age of science has developed into an age of organisation.\nOrganised thought is the basis of organised action,” not, one is tempted to add,\nbecause thought is the basis of action but rather because modern science as “the\norganisation of thought” introduced an element of action into thinking.

That this\nphilosophy, the exact counterpart of a scientific world view long\nsince discarded, has not become obsolete today is not only due to\nthe nature of philosophy, which, wherever it is authentic, possesses\nthe same permanence and durability as art works, but is in this\nparticular case closely related to the eventual evolution of a world\nwhere truths for many centuries accessible only to the few have\nbecome realities for everybody.\n\nIt would be folly indeed to overlook the almost too precise con-\ngruity of modern man's world alienation with the subjectivism of\nmodern philosophy, from Descartes and Hobbes to English sen-\nsualism, empiricism, and pragmatism, as well as German idealism\nand materialism up to the recent phenomenological existentialism\nand logical or epistemological positivism. But it would be equally\nfoolish to believe that what turned the philosopher's mind away\nfrom the old metaphysical questions toward a great variety of in-\ntrospections — introspection into his sensual or cognitive apparatus,\ninto his consciousness, into psychological and logical processes —\nwas an impetus that grew out of an autonomous development of\nideas, or, in a variation of the same approach, to believe that our\nworld would have become different if only philosophy had held\n\n27. Karl Jaspers, in his masterful interpretation of Cartesian philosophy, in-\nsists on the strange ineptitude of Descartes' “scientific” ideas, his lack of under-\nstanding for the spirit of modern science, and his inclination to accept theories\nuncritically without tangible evidence, which had already surprised Spinoza (op.\ncit., esp. pp. 50 ff. and 93 ff.).\n\n28.

Descartes himself was\nquite aware of this, and when he heard of Galileo's trial and his\nrecantation, he was tempted for a moment to burn all his papers,\nbecause “if the movement of the earth is false, all the foundations\nof my philosophy are also false .” 30 But Descartes and the philoso-\nphers, since they elevated what had happened to the level of uncom-\npromising thought, registered with unequaled precision the enor-\nmous shock of the event; they anticipated, at least partially, the\nvery perplexities inherent in the new standpoint of man with which\nthe scientists were too busy to bother until, in our own time, they\nbegan to appear in their own work and to interfere with their own\ninquiries. Since then, the curious discrepancy between the mood of\nmodern philosophy, which from the beginning had been predomi-\nnantly pessimistic, and the mood of modern science, which until\nvery recently had been so buoyantly optimistic, has been bridged.\nThere seems to be little cheerfulness left in either of them.\n",
        "Section 38. THE RISE OF THE CARTESIAN DOUBT": "\nModern philosophy began with Descartes' de omnibus dubitandum\nest, with doubt, but with doubt not as an inherent control of the\nhuman mind to guard against deceptions of thought and illusions of\nsense, not as skepticism against the morals and prejudices of men\nand times, not even as a critical method in scientific inquiry and\nphilosophic speculation. Cartesian doubt is much more far-reaching\nin scope and too fundamental in intent to be determined by such\nconcrete contents. In modern philosophy and thought, doubt occu-\npies much the same central position as that occupied for all the\ncenturies before by the Greek thaumazein , the wonder at every-\nthing that is as it is. Descartes was the first to conceptualize this\nmodern doubting, which after him became the self-evident, in-\n30. See Descartes' letter to Mersenne of November, 1633.\n\n[ 273 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\naudible motor which has moved all thought, the invisible axis\naround which all thinking has been centered. Just as from Plato and\nAristotle to the modern age conceptual philosophy, in its greatest\nand most authentic representatives, had been the articulation of\nwonder, so modern philosophy since Descartes has consisted in the\narticulations and ramifications of doubting.\n\nCartesian doubt, in its radical and universal significance, was\noriginally the response to a new reality, a reality no less real for its\nbeing restricted for centuries to the small and politically insignifi-\ncant circle of scholars and learned men. The philosophers under-\nstood at once that Galileo's discoveries implied no mere challenge\nto the testimony of the senses and that it was no longer reason, as\nin Aristarchus and Copernicus, that had “committed such a rape\non their senses,” in which case men indeed would have needed only\nto choose between their faculties and to let innate reason become\n“the mistress of their credulity .” 31 It was not reason but a man-\nmade instrument, the telescope, which actually changed the physi-\ncal world view; it was not contemplation, observation, and specula-\ntion which led to the new knowledge, but the active stepping in of\nhomo faber, of making and fabricating. In other words, man had\nbeen deceived so long as he trusted that reality and truth would\nreveal themselves to his senses and to his reason if only he re-\nmained true to what he saw with the eyes of body and mind. The\nold opposition of sensual and rational truth, of the inferior truth\ncapacity of the senses and the superior truth capacity of reason,\npaled beside this challenge, beside the obvious implication that\nneither truth nor reality is given, that neither of them appears as\nit is, and that only interference with appearance, doing away with\nappearances, can hold out a hope for true knowledge.\n\nThe extent to which reason and faith in reason depend not upon\nsingle sense perceptions, each of which may be an illusion, but\nupon the unquestioned assumption that the senses as a whole— kept\ntogether and ruled over by common sense, the sixth and the highest\nsense — fit man into the reality which surrounds him, was only now\n\n31. In these words, Galileo expresses his admiration for Copernicus and\nAristarchus, whose reason “was able ... to commit such a rape on their senses,\nas in despite thereof to make herself mistress of their credulity” ( Dialogues con-\ncerning the Two Great Systems of the World, trans. Salusbury [1661], p. 301).\n\n[ 274 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n\ndiscovered. If the human eye can betray man to the extent that so\nmany generations of men were deceived into believing that the sun\nturns around the earth, then the metaphor of the eyes of the mind\ncannot possibly hold any longer; it was based, albeit implicitly and\neven when it was used in opposition to the senses, on an ultimate\ntrust in bodily vision. If Being and Appearance part company for-\never, and this— as Marx once remarked — is indeed the basic as-\nsumption of all modern science, then there is nothing left to be\ntaken upon faith; everything must be doubted. It was as though\nDemocritus' early prediction that a victory of the mind over the\nsenses could end only in the mind's defeat had come true, except\nthat now the reading of an instrument seemed to have won a\nvictory over both the mind and the senses. 3ia\n\nThe outstanding characteristic of Cartesian doubt is its univer-\nsality, that nothing, no thought and no experience, can escape it.\nNo one perhaps explored its true dimensions more honestly than\nKierkegaard when he leaped — not from reason, as he thought, but\nfrom doubt — into belief, thereby carrying doubt into the very\nheart of modern religion . 32 Its universality spreads from the testi-\nmony of the senses to the testimony of reason to the testimony of\nfaith because this doubt resides ultimately in the loss of self-evi-\ndence, and all thought had always started from what is evident in\nand by itself — evident not only for the thinker but for everybody.\nCartesian doubt did not simply doubt that human understanding\nmay not be open to every truth or that human vision may not be\nable to see everything, but that intelligibility to human understand-\ning does not at all constitute a demonstration of truth, just as visi-\nbility did not at all constitute proof of reality. This doubt doubts\n\n31a. Democritus, after having stated that “in reality there is no white, or\nblack, or bitter, or sweet,” added: “Poor mind, from the senses you take your\narguments, and then want to defeat them? Your victory is your defeat” (Diels,\nFragment der Vorsokratiker [4th ed., 1922], frag. B125).\n\n32. See Johannes Climacus oder De omnibus dubitandum est, one of the earliest\nmanuscripts of Kierkegaard and perhaps still the deepest interpretation of Carte-\nsian doubt. It tells in the form of a spiritual autobiography how he learned about\nDescartes from Hegel and then regretted not having started his philosophical\nstudies with his works. This little treatise, the Danish edition of the Collected\nWorks (Copenhagen, 1909), Vol. IV, is available in a German translation (Darm-\nstadt, 1948).\n\n[ 275 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthat such a thing as truth exists at all, and discovers thereby that\nthe traditional concept of truth, whether based on sense perception\nor on reason or on belief in divine revelation, had rested on the\ntwofold assumption that what truly is will appear of its own accord\nand that human capabilities are adequate to receive it . 33 That truth\nreveals itself was the common creed of pagan and Hebrew antiq-\nuity, of Christian and secular philosophy. This is the reason why\nthe new, modern philosophy turned with such vehemence — in fact\nwith a violence bordering on hatred— against tradition, making\nshort shrift of the enthusiastic Renaissance revival and rediscovery\nof antiquity.\n\nThe poignancy of Descartes' doubt is fully realized only if one\nunderstands that the new discoveries dealt an even more disastrous\nblow to human confidence in the world and in the universe than is\nindicated by a clear-cut separation of being and appearance. For\nhere the relationship between these two is no longer static as it was\nin traditional skepticism, as though appearances simply hide and\ncover a true being which forever escapes the notice of man. This\nBeing, on the contrary, is tremendously active and energetic: it\ncreates its own appearances, except that these appearances are de-\nlusions. Whatever human senses perceive is brought about by in-\nvisible, secret forces, and if through certain devices, ingenious in-\nstruments, these forces are caught in the act rather than discovered\n—as an animal is trapped or a thief is caught much against their\nown will and intentions — it turns out that this tremendously effec-\n\n33. The close relatedness of confidence in the senses and confidence in reason\nin the traditional concept of truth was clearly recognized by Pascal. According to\nhim: “Ces deux principes de verite, la raison et les sens, outre qu'ils manquent\nchacun de sincerite, s'abusent reciproquement l'un et l'autre. Les sens abusent la\nraison par de fausses apparences; et cette meme piperie qu'ils apportent a la\nraison, ils la refoivent d'elle a leur tour: elle s'en revanche. Les passions de 1 ame\ntroublent les sens, et leur font des impressions fausses. Ils mentent et se trompent\ni l'envi” (Pensees [Pleiades ed., 1950], No. 92, p. 849). Pascal's famous wager\nthat he certainly would risk less by believing what Christianity has to teach about\na hereafter than by disbelieving it is sufficient demonstration of the interrelated-\nness of rational and sensory truth with the truth of divine revelation. To Pascal,\nas to Descartes, God is un Dieu cache {ibid., No. 366, p. 923) who does not reveal\nhimself, but whose existence and even goodness is the only hypothetical guaranty\nthat human life is not a dream (the Cartesian nightmare recurs in Pascal, ibid..\nNo. 380, p. 928) and human knowledge not a divine fraud.\n\n[ 27d ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\ntive Being is of such a nature that its disclosures must be illusions\nand that conclusions drawn from its appearances must be delusions.\n\nDescartes' philosophy is haunted by two nightmares which in a\nsense became the nightmares of the whole modern age, not because\nthis age was so deeply influenced by Cartesian philosophy, but be-\ncause their emergence was almost inescapable once the true impli-\ncations of the modern world view were understood. These night-\nmares are very simple and very well known. In the one, reality, the\nreality of the world as well as of human life, is doubted; if neither\nthe senses nor common sense nor reason can be trusted, then it may\nwell be that all that we take for reality is only a dream. The other\nconcerns the general human condition as it was revealed by the\nnew discoveries and the impossibility for man to trust his senses\nand his reason; under these circumstances it seems, indeed, much\nmore likely that an evil spirit, a Dieu trompeur , wilfully and spite-\nfully betrays man than that God is the ruler of the universe. The\nconsummate devilry of this evil spirit would consist in having cre-\nated a creature which harbors a notion of truth only to bestow on it\nsuch other faculties that it will never be able to reach any truth,\nnever be able to be certain of anything.\n\nIndeed, this last point, the question of certainty, was to become\ndecisive for the whole development of modern morality. What was\nlost in the modem age, of course, was not the capacity for truth or\nreality or faith nor the concomitant inevitable acceptance of the\ntestimony of the senses and of reason, but the certainty that for-\nmerly went with it. In religion it was not belief in salvation or a\nhereafter that was immediately lost, but the certitudo salutis — and\nthis happened in all Protestant countries where the downfall of the\nCatholic Church had eliminated the last tradition-bound institution\nwhich, wherever its authority remained unchallenged, stood be-\ntween the impact of modernity and the masses of believers. Just as\nthe immediate consequence of this loss of certainty was a new zeal\nfor making good in this life as though it were only an overlong\nperiod of probation , 34 so the loss of certainty of truth ended in a\n\n34. Max Weber, who, despite some errors in detail which by now have been\ncorrected, is still the only historian who raised the question of the modern age\nwith the depth and relevance corresponding to its importance, was also aware\nthat it was not a simple loss of faith that caused the reversal in the estimate of\n\n[ 277 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nnew, entirely unprecedented zeal for truthfulness— as though man\ncould afford to be a liar only so long as he was certain of the\nunchallengeable existence of truth and objective reality, which\nsurely would survive and defeat all his lies . 36 The radical change in\nmoral standards occurring in the first century of the modern age\nwas inspired by the needs and ideals of its most important group of\nmen, the new scientists; and the modern cardinal virtues— success,\nindustry, and truthfulness — are at the same time the greatest\nvirtues of modern science . 86\n\nThe learned societies and Royal Academies became the morally\ninfluential centers where scientists were organized to find ways\nand means by which nature could be trapped by experiments and\ninstruments so that she would be forced to yield her secrets. And\nthis gigantic task, to which no single man but only the collective\neffort of the best minds of mankind could possibly be adequate,\nprescribed the rules of behavior and the new standards of judg-\nment. Where formerly truth had resided in the kind of “theory”\nthat since the Greeks had meant the contemplative glance of the\nbeholder who was concerned with, and received, the reality open-\ning up before him, the question of success took over and the test of\ntheory became a “practical” one — whether or not it will work.\nTheory became hypothesis, and the success of the hypothesis be-\ncame truth. This all-important standard of success, however, does\nnot depend upon practical considerations or the technical develop-\nments which may or may not accompany specific scientific dis-\ncoveries. The criterion of success is inherent in the very essence\nand progress of modern science quite apart from its applicability.\nSuccess here is not at all the empty idol to which it degenerated in\n\n\nwork and labor, but the loss of the certitudo salutis, of the certainty of salvation.\nIn our context, it would appear that this certainty was only one among the many\ncertainties lost with the arrival of the modern age.\n\n35. It certainly is quite striking that not one of the major religions, with the\nexception of Zoroastrianism, has ever included lying as such among the mortal\nsins. Not only is there no commandment: Thou shalt not lie (for the command-\nment: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, is of course of a\ndifferent nature), but it seems as though prior to puritan morality nobody ever\nconsidered lies to be serious offenses.\n\n36. This is the chief point of Bronowski's article quoted above.\n\n[ 278 )\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nbourgeois society; it was, and in the sciences has been ever since, a\nveritable triumph of human ingenuity against overwhelming odds.\n\nThe Cartesian solution of universal doubt or its salvation from\nthe two interconnected nightmares — that everything is a dream\nand there is no reality and that not God but an evil spirit rules the\nworld and mocks man— was similar in method and content to the\nturning away from truth to truthfulness and from reality to relia-\nbility. Descartes' conviction that “though our mind is not the\nmeasure of things or of truth, it must assuredly be the measure of\nthings that we affirm or deny ” 37 echoes what scientists in general\nand without explicit articulation had discovered: that even if there\nis no truth, man can be truthful, and even if there is no reliable\ncertainty, man can be reliable. If there was salvation, it had to lie\nin man himself, and if there was a solution to the questions raised\nby doubting, it had to come from doubting. If everything has be-\ncome doubtful, then doubting at least is certain and real. Whatever\nmay be the state of reality and of truth as they are given to the\nsenses and to reason, “nobody can doubt of his doubt and remain\nuncertain whether he doubts or does not doubt .” 38 The famous\ncogito ergo sum (“I think, hence I am”) did not spring for Descartes\nfrom any self-certainty of thought as such — in which case, indeed,\nthought would have acquired a new dignity and significance for\nman — but was a mere generalization of a dubito ergo sum. HS In\n\n37. From a letter of Descartes to Henry More, quoted from Koyre, op. cit.,\np. 117.\n\n38. In the dialogue La recherche de la verite par la lumiere natmelle , where\nDescartes exposes his fundamental insights without technical formality, the cen-\ntral position of doubting is even more in evidence than in his other works. Thus\nEudoxe, who stands for Descartes, explains: “Vous pouvez douter avec raison de\ntoutes les choses dont la connaissance lie vous vient que par l'office des sens; mais\npouvez-vous douter de votre doute et rester incertain si vous doutez ou non? . . .\nvous qui doutez vous etes, et cela est si vrai que vous n'en pouvez douter davan-\ntage” (Pleiade ed., p. 680).\n\n39. “Je doute, done je suis, ou bien ce qui est la meme chose: je pense, done je\nsuis” (ibid., p. 687) . Thought in Descartes has indeed a mere derivative char-\nacter: “Car s'il est vrai que je doute, comme je n'en puis douter, il est egalement\nvrai que je pense; en effet douter est-il autre chose que penser d'une certaine\nmaniere?” (ibid., p. 686) . The leading idea of this philosophy is by no means that\nI would not be able to think without being, but that “nous ne saurions douter sans\netre, et que cela est la premiere connaissance certaine qu'on peut acquerir” (Prin-\n\n[ 279 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nother words, from the mere logical certainty that in doubting some-\nthing I remain aware of a process of doubting in my consciousness,\nDescartes concluded that those processes which go on in the mind\nof man himself have a certainty of their own, that they can become\nthe object of investigation in introspection.\n",
        "Section 39. INTROSPECTION AND THE LOSS OF COMMON SENSE": "\nIntrospection, as a matter of fact, not the reflection of man's mind\non the state of his soul or body but the sheer cognitive concern of\nconsciousness with its own content (and this is the essence of the\nCartesian cogitatio, where cogito always means cogito me cogitare )\nmust yield certainty, because here nothing is involved except what\nthe mind has produced itself; nobody is interfering but the producer\nof the product, man is confronted with nothing and nobody but\nhimself. Long before the natural and physical sciences began to\nwonder if man is capable of encountering, knowing, and compre-\nhending anything except himself, modern philosophy had made\nsure in introspection that man concerns himself only with himself.\nDescartes believed that the certainty yielded by his new method of\nintrospection is the certainty of the I-am . 40 Man, in other words,\ncarries his certainty, the certainty of his existence, within himself;\nthe sheer functioning of consciousness, though it cannot possibly\nassure a worldly reality given to the senses and to reason, confirms\nbeyond doubt the reality of sensations and of reasoning, that is, the\nreality of processes which go on in the mind. These are not unlike\n\ncipes [Pleiade ed.], Part I, sec. 7). The argument itself is of course not new. One\nfinds it, for instance, almost word for word in Augustine's De libero arbitrio (ch.\n3), but without the implication that this is the only certainty against the possibil-\nity of a Dieu trcmpeur and, generally, without being the very fundament of a\nphilosophical system.\n\n40. That the cogito ergo sum contains a logical error, that, as Nietzsche pointed\nout, it should read: cogito, ergo cogitationes sunt, and that therefore the mental\nawareness expressed in the cogito does not prove that I am, but only that con-\nsciousness is, is another matter and need not interest us here (see Nietzsche,\nWille zur Macht, No. 484) .\n\n\n[ 280 }\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthe biological processes that go on in the body and which, when\none becomes aware of them, can also convince one of its working\nreality. In so far as even dreams are real, since they presuppose a\ndreamer and a dream, the world of consciousness is real enough.\nThe trouble is only that just as it would be impossible to infer from\nthe awareness of bodily processes the actual shape of any body, in-\ncluding one's own, so it is impossible to reach out from the mere\nconsciousness of sensations, in which one senses his senses and in\nwhich even the sensed object becomes part of sensation, into reality\nwith its shapes, forms, colors, and constellations. The seen tree\nmay be real enough for the sensation of vision, just as the dreamed\ntree is real enough for the dreamer as long as the dream lasts, but\nneither can ever become a real tree.\n\nIt is out of these perplexities that Descartes and Leibniz needed\nto prove, not the existence of God, but his goodness, the one dem-\nonstrating that no evil spirit rules the world and mocks man and\nthe other that this world, including man, is the best of all possible\nworlds. The point about these exclusively modern justifications,\nknown since Leibniz as theodicies, is that the doubt does not con-\ncern the existence of a highest being, which, on the contrary, is\ntaken for granted, but concerns his revelation, as given in biblical\ntradition, and his intentions with respect to man and world, or\nrather the adequateness of the relationship between man and world.\nOf these two, the doubt that the Bible or nature contains divine\nrevelation is a matter of course, once it has been shown that revela-\ntion as such, the disclosure of reality to the senses and of truth to\nreason, is no guaranty for either. Doubt of the goodness of God,\nhowever, the notion of a Dieu trompeur , arose out of the very ex-\nperience of deception inherent in the acceptance of the new world\nview, a deception whose poignancy lies in its irremediable repeti-\ntiveness, for no knowledge about the heliocentric nature of our\nplanetary system can change the fact that every day the sun is seen\ncircling the earth, rising and setting at its preordained location.\nOnly now, when it appeared as though man, if it had not been for\nthe accident of the telescope, might have been deceived forever,\ndid the ways of God really become wholly inscrutable; the more\nman learned about the universe, the less he could understand the\nintentions and purposes for which he should have been created.\n\n[ 281 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe goodness of the God of the theodicies, therefore, is strictly the\nquality of a deus ex machina ; inexplicable goodness is ultimately the\nonly thing that saves reality in Descartes' philosophy (the co-\nexistence of mind and extension, res cogitans and res extensd), as it\nsaves the prestabilized harmony between man and world in Leib-\nniz . 41\n\nThe very ingenuity of Cartesian introspection, and hence the\nreason why this philosophy became so all-important to the spiritual\nand intellectual development of the modern age, lies first in that it\nhad used the nightmare of non-reality as a means of submerging all\nworldly objects into the stream of consciousness and its processes.\nThe “seen tree” found in consciousness through introspection is no\nlonger the tree given in sight and touch, an entity in itself with an\nunalterable identical shape of its own. By being processed into an\nobject of consciousness on the same level with a merely remem-\nbered or entirely imaginary thing, it becomes part and parcel of\nthis process itself, of that consciousness, that is, which one knows\nonly as an ever-moving stream. Nothing perhaps could prepare our\nminds better for the eventual dissolution of matter into energy, of\nobjects into a whirl of atomic occurrences, than this dissolution of\nobjective reality into subjective states of mind or, rather, into sub-\njective mental processes. Second, and this was of even greater\nrelevance to the initial stages of the modern age, the Cartesian\nmethod of securing certainty against universal doubt corresponded\nmost precisely to the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from\nthe new physical science: though one cannot know truth as some-\nthing given and disclosed, man can at least know what he makes\nhimself. This, indeed, became the most general and most generally\naccepted attitude of the modern age, and it is this conviction, rather\n\n41. This quality of God as a deus ex machina , as the only possible solution to\nuniversal doubt, is especially manifest in Descartes' Meditations. Thus, he says in\nthe third meditation: In order to eliminate the cause of doubting, “je dois examiner\ns'il y a un Dieu . . . ; et si je trouve qu'il y en ait un, je dois aussi examiner s'il peut\netre trompeur: car sans la connaissance de ces deux verites, je ne vois pas que je\npuisse jamais etre certain d'aucune chose.” And he concludes at the end of the\nfifth meditation: “Ainsi je reconnais tres clairement que la certitude et la verite\nde toute science depend de la seule connaissance du vrai Dieu: en sorte qu'avant\nque je le connusse, je ne pouvais savoir parfaitement aucune autre chose”\n(Pleiade ed., pp. 177, 208).\n\n[ 252 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthan the doubt underlying it, that propelled one generation after\nanother for more than three hundred years into an ever-quickening\npace of discovery and development.\n\nCartesian reason is entirely based “on the implicit assumption\nthat the mind can only know that which it has itself produced and\nretains in some sense within itself .” 42 Its highest ideal must there-\nfore be mathematical knowledge as the modern age understands it,\nthat is, not the knowledge of ideal forms given outside the mind\nbut of forms produced by a mind which in this particular instance\ndoes not even need the stimulation — or, rather, the irritation — of\nthe senses by objects other than itself. This theory is certainly\nwhat Whitehead calls it, “the outcome of common-sense in re-\ntreat .” 48 For common sense, which once had been the one by which\nall other senses, with their intimately private sensations, were\nfitted into the common world, just as vision fitted man into the\nvisible world, now became an inner faculty without any world re-\nlationship. This sense now was called common merely because it\nhappened to be common to all. What men now have in common is\nnot the world but the structure of their minds, and this they cannot\nhave in common, strictly speaking; their faculty of reasoning can\nonly happen to be the same in everybody . 44 The fact that, given the\nproblem of two plus two we all will come out with the same answer,\nfour, is henceforth the very model of common-sense reasoning.\n\nReason, in Descartes no less than in Hobbes, becomes “reckon-\ning with consequences,” the faculty of deducing and concluding,\nthat is, of a process which man at any moment can let loose within\nhimself. The mind of this man — to remain in the sphere of mathe-\nmatics — no longer looks upon “two-and-two-are-four” as an equa-\ntion in which two sides balance in a self-evident harmony, but un-\nderstands the equation as the expression of a process in which two\nand two become four in order to generate further processes of addi-\n\n42. A. N. Whitehead, The Concept of Nature (Ann Arbor ed.), p. 32.\n\n43. Ibid., p. 43. The first to comment on and criticize the absence of common\nsense in Descartes was Vico (see De nostri temporis studiorum ratione, ch. 3) .\n\n44. This transformation of common sense into an inner sense is characteristic\nof the whole modem age; in the German language it is indicated by the difference\nbetween the older German word Gemeinsinn and the more recent expression\ngesunder Menschenverstand which replaced it.\n\n[ 283 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntion which eventually will lead into the infinite. This faculty the\nmodern age calls common-sense reasoning; it is the playing of the\nmind with itself, which comes to pass when the mind is shut off\nfrom all reality and “senses” only itself. The results of this play\nare compelling “truths” because the structure of one man's mind is\nsupposed to differ no more from that of another than the shape of\nhis body. Whatever difference there may be is a difference of\nmental power, which can be tested and measured like horsepower.\nHere the old definition of man as an animal rationale acquires a ter-\nrible precision: deprived of the sense through which man's five\nanimal senses are fitted into a world common to all men, human\nbeings are indeed no more than animals who are able to reason, “to\nreckon with consequences.”\n\nThe perplexity inherent in the discovery of the Archimedean\npoint was and still is that the point outside the earth was found by\nan earth-bound creature, who found that he himself lived not only\nin a different but in a topsy-turvy world the moment he tried to\napply his universal world view to his actual surroundings. The\nCartesian solution of this perplexity was to move the Archimedean\npoint into man himself , 46 to choose as ultimate point of reference\nthe pattern of the human mind itself, which assures itself of reality\nand certainty within a framework of mathematical formulas which\nare its own products. Here the famous reductio scientiae ad mathe-\nmaticam permits replacement of what is sensuously given by a sys-\ntem of mathematical equations where all real relationships are dis-\nsolved into logical relations between man-made symbols. It is this\nreplacement which permits modern science to fulfil its “task of\n■producing' the phenomena and objects it wishes to observe . 46 And\nthe assumption is that neither God nor an evil spirit can change the\nfact that two and two equal four.\n\n45. This removal of the Archimedean point into man himself was a conscious\noperation of Descartes: “Car & partir de ce doute universel, coinme a partir d'un\npoint fixe et immobile, je me suis propose de faire deriver la connaissance de\nDieu, de vous-memes et de toutes les choses qui existent dans le monde”\n( Recherche de la verite, p. 680) .\n\n46. Frank, op. cit., defines science by its “task of producing desired observable\nphenomena.”\n\n[ 284 )\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n",
        "Section 40. THOUGHT AND THE MODERN WORLD VIEW": "\nThe Cartesian removal of the Archimedean point into the mind of\nman, while it enabled man to carry it, as it were, within himself\nwherever he went and thus freed him from given reality altogether\n— that is, from the human condition of being an inhabitant of the\nearth— has perhaps never been as convincing as the universal doubt\nfrom which it sprang and which it was supposed to dispel . 47 Today,\nat any rate, we find in the perplexities confronting natural scientists\nin the midst of their greatest triumphs the same nightmares which\nhave haunted the philosophers from the beginning of the modern\nage. This nightmare is present in the fact that a mathematical\nequation, such as of mass and energy— which originally was des-\ntined only to save the phenomena, to be in agreement with observ-\nable facts that could also be explained differently, just as the\nPtolemaic and Copernican systems originally differed only in sim-\nplicity and harmony — actually lends itself to a very real conversion\nof mass into energy and vice versa, so that the mathematical “con-\nversion” implicit in every equation corresponds to convertibility in\nreality; it is present in the weird phenomenon that the systems of\nnon-Euclidean mathematics were found without any forethought of\napplicability or even empirical meaning before they gained their\nsurprising validity in Einstein's theory; and it is even more trou-\nbling in the inevitable conclusion that “the possibility of such an\napplication must be held open for all, even the most remote con-\nstructions of pure mathematics .” 48 If it should be true that a whole\nuniverse, or rather any number of utterly different universes will\nspring into existence and “prove” whatever over-all pattern the\n\n47. Ernst Cassirer's hope that “doubt is overcome by being outdone” and that\nthe theory of relativity would free the human mind from its last “earthly re-\nmainder,” namely, the anthropomorphism inherent in “the manner in which we\nmake empirical measurements of space and time” {op. cit., pp. 389, 382), has not\nbeen fulfilled; on the contrary, doubt not of the validity of scientific statements\nbut of the intelligibility of scientific data has increased during the last decades.\n\n48. Ibid., p. 443.\n\n[ 28 ! ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nhuman mind has constructed, then man may indeed, for a moment,\nrejoice in a reassertion of the “pre-established harmony between\npure mathematics and physics ,” 49 between mind and matter, be-\ntween man and the universe. But it will be difficult to ward off the\nsuspicion that this mathematically preconceived world may be a\ndream world where every dreamed vision man himself produces\nhas the character of reality only as long as the dream lasts. And his\nsuspicions will be enforced when he must discover that the events\nand occurrences in the infinitely small, the atom, follow the same\nlaws and regularities as in the infinitely large, the planetary sys-\ntems . 60 What this seems to indicate is that if we inquire into nature\nfrom the standpoint of astronomy we receive planetary systems,\nwhile if we carry out our astronomical inquiries from the stand-\npoint of the earth we receive geocentric, terrestrial systems.\n\nIn any event, wherever we try to transcend appearance beyond\nall sensual experience, even instrument-aided, in order to catch the\nultimate secrets of Being, which according to our physical world\nview is so secretive that it never appears and still so tremendously\npowerful that it produces all appearance, we find that the same\npatterns rule the macrocosm and the microcosm alike, that we\nreceive the same instrument readings. Here again, we may for a\nmoment rejoice in a refound unity of the universe, only to fall prey\nto the suspicion that what we have found may have nothing to do\nwith either the macrocosmos or the microcosmos, that we deal\nonly with the patterns of our own mind, the mind which designed\nthe instruments and put nature under its conditions in the experi-\nment-prescribed its laws to nature, in Kant's phrase— in which\ncase it is really as though we were in the hands of an evil spirit who\n\n49. Hermann Minkowski, “Raum und Zeit,” in Lorentz, Einstein, and Min-\nkowski, Das Relativitdtsprinzip (1913); quoted from Cassirer, op. cit., p. 419.\n\n50. And this doubt is not assuaged if another coincidence is added, the coin-\ncidence between logic and reality. Logically, it seems evident indeed that “the\nelectrons if they were to explain the sensory qualities of matter could not very\nwell possess these sensory qualities, since in that case the question for the cause\nof these qualities would simply have been removed one step farther, but not\nsolved” (Heisenberg, Wandlungen in den Grundlagen der Naturivissenschaft, p. 66).\nThe reason why we become suspicious is that only when “in the course of time”\nthe scientists became aware of this logical necessity did they discover that\n“matter” had no qualities and therefore could no longer be called matter.\n\n[ 286 ]\n\n\n\nmocks us and frustrates our thirst for knowledge, so that wherever\nwe search for that which we are not, we encounter only the pat-\nterns of our own minds.\n\nCartesian doubt, logically the most plausible and chronologically\nthe most immediate consequence of Galileo's discovery, was as-\nsuaged for centuries through the ingenious removal of the Archi-\nmedean point into man himself, at least so far as natural science\nwas concerned. But the mathematization of physics, by which the\nabsolute renunciation of the senses for the purpose of knowing was\ncarried through, had in its last stages the unexpected and yet\nplausible consequence that every question man puts to nature is\nanswered in terms of mathematical patterns to which no model can\never be adequate, since one would have to be shaped after our sense\nexperiences . 51 At this point, the connection between thought and\nsense experience, inherent in the human condition, seems to take\nits revenge: while technology demonstrates the “truth” of modern\nscience's most abstract concepts, it demonstrates no more than\nthat man can always apply the results of his mind, that no matter\nwhich system he uses for the explanation of natural phenomena he\nwill always be able to adopt it as a guiding principle for making and\nacting. This possibility was latent even in the beginnings of modern\nmathematics, when it turned out that numerical truths can be fully\ntranslated into spatial relationships. If, therefore, present-day sci-\nence in its perplexity points to technical achievements to “prove”\nthat we deal with an “authentic order” given in nature , 52 it seems it\nhas fallen into a vicious circle, which can be formulated as follows:\nscientists formulate their hypotheses to arrange their experiments\nand then use these experiments to verify their hypotheses; during\nthis whole enterprise, they obviously deal with a hypothetical\nnature . 63\n\n51. In the words of Erwin Schrodinger: “As our mental eye penetrates into\nsmaller and smaller distances and shorter and shorter times, we find nature behav-\ning so entirely differently from what we observe in visible and palpable bodies of\nour surrounding that no model shaped after our large-scale experiences can ever be\n‘true' ” ( Science and Humanism [1952], p. 25).\n\n52. Heisenberg, Wandlungen in den Grundlagen , p. 64.\n\n53. This point is best illustrated by a statement of Planck, quoted in a very\nilluminating article by Simone Weil (published under the pseudonym “Emil\nNovis” and entitled “Reflexions a propos de la theorie des quanta,” in Cahiers du\n\n[ 287 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nIn other words, the world of the experiment seems always\ncapable of becoming a man-made reality, and this, while it may\nincrease man's power of making and acting, even of creating a\nworld, far beyond what any previous age dared to imagine in dream\nand phantasy, unfortunately puts man back once more — and now\neven more forcefully — into the prison of his own mind, into the\nlimitations of patterns he himself created. The moment he wants\nwhat all ages before him were capable of achieving, that is, to ex-\nperience the reality of what he himself is not, he will find that\nnature and the universe “escape him” and that a universe construed\naccording to the behavior of nature in the experiment and in ac-\ncordance with the very principles which man can translate techni-\ncally into a working reality lacks all possible representation. What\nis new here is not that things exist of which we cannot form an\nimage — such “things” were always known and among them, for\ninstance, belonged the “soul” — but that the material things we see\nand represent and against which we had measured immaterial\nthings for which we can form no images should likewise be “unim-\naginable.” With the disappearance of the sensually given world,\nthe transcendent world disappears as well, and with it the possibil-\nity of transcending the material world in concept and thought.\nIt is therefore not surprising that the new universe is not only\n“practically inaccessible but not even thinkable,” for “however\nwe think it, it is wrong; not perhaps quite as meaningless as a\n‘triangular circle,' but much more so than a ‘winged lion.' ” 64\n\nCartesian universal doubt has now reached the heart of physical\n\nSud [December, 1942]), which in the French translation runs as follows: “Le\ncreateur d'une hypothese dispose de possibilites pratiquement illimitees, il est\naussi peu lie par le fonctionnement des organes de ses sens qu'il ne Test par celui\n\ndes instruments dont il se sert On peut meme dire qu'il se cree une geometric\n\na sa fantasie. . . . C'est pourquoi aussi jamais des mesures ne pourront confirmer\nni infirmer directement une hypothese; elles pourront seulement en faire res-\nsortir la convenance plus ou moins grande.” Simone Weil points out at length how\nsomething “infiniment plus precieux” than science is compromised in this crisis,\nnamely, the notion of truth; she fails, however, to see that the greatest perplexity\nin this state of affairs arises from the undeniable fact that these hypotheses\n“work.” (I owe the reference to this little known article to Miss Beverly Wood-\nward, a former student of mine.)\n\n54. Schrodinger, op. cit., p. 26.\n\n\n[ 288 1\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nscience itself; for the escape into the mind of man himself is closed\nif it turns out that the modern physical universe is not only beyond\npresentation, which is a matter of course under the assumption that\nnature and Being do not reveal themselves to the senses, but is\ninconceivable, unthinkable in terms of pure reasoning as well.\n",
        "Section 41. THE REVERSAL OF CONTEMPLATION AND ACTION": "\nPerhaps the most momentous of the spiritual consequences of the\ndiscoveries of the modern age and, at the same time, the only one\nthat could not have been avoided, since it followed closely upon the\ndiscovery of the Archimedean point and the concomitant rise of\nCartesian doubt, has been the reversal of the hierarchical order\nbetween the vita contemplativa and the vita activa.\n\nIn order to understand how compelling the motives for this re-\nversal were, it is first of all necessary to rid ourselves of the cur-\nrent prejudice which ascribes the development of modern science,\nbecause of its applicability, to a pragmatic desire to improve condi-\ntions and better human life on earth. It is a matter of historical\nrecord that modern technology has its origins not in the evolution\nof those tools man had always devised for the twofold purpose of\neasing his labors and erecting the human artifice, but exclusively in\nan altogether non-practical search for useless knowledge. Thus,\nthe watch, one of the first modern instruments, was not invented\nfor purposes of practical life, but exclusively for the highly “theo-\nretical” purpose of conducting certain experiments with nature.\nThis invention, to be sure, once its practical usefulness became\napparent, changed the whole rhythm and the very physiognomy of\nhuman life; but from the standpoint of the inventors, this was a\nmere incident. If we had to rely only on men's so-called practical\ninstincts, there would never have been any technology to speak of,\nand although today the already existing technical inventions carry\na certain momentum which will probably generate improvements\nup to a certain point, it is not likely that our technically conditioned\nworld could survive, let alone develop further, if we ever succeeded\nin convincing ourselves that man is primarily a practical being.\n\n[ 289 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nHowever that may be, the fundamental experience behind the\nreversal of contemplation and action was precisely that man's\nthirst for knowledge could be assuaged only after he had put his\ntrust into the ingenuity of his hands. The point was not that truth\nand knowledge were no longer important, but that they could be\nwon only by “action” and not by contemplation. It was an instru-\nment, the telescope, a work of man's hands, which finally forced\nnature, or rather the universe, to yield its secrets. The reasons for\ntrusting doing and for distrusting contemplation or observation be-\ncame even more cogent after the results of the first active inquiries.\nAfter being and appearance had parted company and truth was no\nlonger supposed to appear, to reveal and disclose itself to the\nmental eye of a beholder, there arose a veritable necessity to hunt\nfor truth behind deceptive appearances. Nothing indeed could be\nless trustworthy for acquiring knowledge and approaching truth\nthan passive observation or mere contemplation. In order to be cer-\ntain one had to make sure , and in order to know one had to do. Cer-\ntainty of knowledge could be reached only under a twofold condi-\ntion: first, that knowledge concerned only what one had done him-\nself — so that its ideal became mathematical knowledge, where we\ndeal only with self-made entities of the mind — and second, that\nknowledge was of such a nature that it could be tested only\nthrough more doing.\n\nSince then, scientific and philosophic truth have parted company;\nscientific truth not only need not be eternal, it need not even be\ncomprehensible or adequate to human reason. It took many genera-\ntions of scientists before the human mind grew bold enough to fully\nface this implication of modernity. If nature and the universe are\nproducts of a divine maker, and if the human mind is incapable of\nunderstanding what man has not made himself, then man cannot\npossibly expect to learn anything about nature that he can under-\nstand. He may be able, through ingenuity, to find out and even to\nimitate the devices of natural processes, but that does not mean\nthese devices will ever make sense to him — they do not have to be\nintelligible. As a matter of fact, no supposedly suprarational divine\nrevelation and no supposedly abstruse philosophic truth has ever\noffended human reason so glaringly as certain results of modern\nscience. One can indeed say with Whitehead: “Heaven knows\n\n[ 290 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n\nwhat seeming nonsense may not to-morrow be demonstrated\ntruth .” 55\n\nActually, the change that took place in the seventeenth century\nwas more radical than what a simple reversal of the established\ntraditional order between contemplation and doing is apt to indi-\ncate. The reversal, strictly speaking, concerned only the relation-\nship between thinking and doing, whereas contemplation, in the\noriginal sense of beholding the truth, was altogether eliminated.\nFor thought and contemplation are not the same. Traditionally,\nthought was conceived as the most direct and important way to\nlead to the contemplation of truth. Since Plato, and probably since\nSocrates, thinking was understood as the inner dialogue in which\none speaks with himself (eme emauto, to recall the idiom current in\nPlato's dialogues); and although this dialogue lacks all outward\nmanifestation and even requires a more or less complete cessation\nof all other activities, it constitutes in itself a highly active state.\nIts outward inactivity is clearly separated from the passivity, the\ncomplete stillness, in which truth is finally revealed to man. If\nmedieval scholasticism looked upon philosophy as the handmaiden\nof theology, it could very well have appealed to Plato and Aris-\ntotle themselves; both, albeit in a very different context, consid-\nered this dialogical thought process to be the way to prepare the\nsoul and lead the mind to a beholding of truth beyond thought and\nbeyond speech — a truth that is arrheton, incapable of being com-\nmunicated through words, as Plato put it , 66 or beyond speech, as in\nAristotle . 67\n\nThe reversal of the modern age consisted then not in raising\ndoing to the rank of contemplating as the highest state of which\nhuman beings are capable, as though henceforth doing was the ulti-\nmate meaning for the sake of which contemplation was to be per-\nformed, just as, up to that time, all activities of the vita activa had\nbeen judged and justified to the extent that they made the vita con-\n\n55.

See esp. Nicomachean Ethics 1 142a25 ff. and 1 143a36 ff. The current Eng-\nlish translation distorts the meaning because it renders logos as “reason” or\n“argument.”\n\n[ 291 }\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ntemplativa possible. The reversal concerned only thinking, which\nfrom then on was the handmaiden of doing as it had been the ancilla\ntheologiae, the handmaiden of contemplating divine truth in medie-\nval philosophy and the handmaiden of contemplating the truth of\nBeing in ancient philosophy. Contemplation itself became alto-\ngether meaningless.\n\nThe radicality of this reversal is somehow obscured by another\nkind of reversal, with which it is frequently identified and which,\nsince Plato, has dominated the history of Western thought. Who-\never reads the Cave allegory in Plato's Republic in the light of\nGreek history will soon be aware that the periagoge, the turning-\nabout that Plato demands of the philosopher, actually amounts to a\nreversal of the Homeric world order. Not life after death, as in the\nHomeric Hades, but ordinary life on earth, is located in a “cave,”\nin an underworld; the soul is not the shadow of the body, but the\nbody the shadow of the soul; and the senseless, ghostlike motion\nascribed by Homer to the lifeless existence of the soul after death\nin Hades is now ascribed to the senseless doings of men who do\nnot leave the cave of human existence to behold the eternal ideas\nvisible in the sky . 58\n\nIn this context, I am concerned only with the fact that the Pla-\ntonic tradition of philosophical as well as political thought started\nwith a reversal, and that this original reversal determined to a large\nextent the thought patterns into which Western philosophy almost\nautomatically fell wherever it was not animated by a great and\noriginal philosophical impetus. Academic philosophy, as a matter\nof fact, has ever since been dominated by the never-ending rever-\nsals of idealism and materialism, of transcendentalism and im-\nmanentism, of realism and nominalism, of hedonism and asceticism,\nand so on. What matters here is the reversibility of all these sys-\ntems, that they can be turned “upside down” or “downside up”\nat any moment in history without requiring for such reversal either\nhistorical events or changes in the structural elements involved.\nThe concepts themselves remain the same no matter where they\n\n58. It is particularly Plato's use of the words eidolon and skia in the story of the\nCave which makes the whole account read like a reversal of and a reply to\nHomer; for these are the key words in Homer's description of Hades in the\nOdyssey.\n\n[ 292 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nare placed in the various systematic orders. Once Plato had suc-\nceeded in making these structural elements and concepts reversible,\nreversals within the course of intellectual history no longer needed\nmore than purely intellectual experience, an experience within the\nframework of conceptual thinking itself. These reversals already\nbegan with the philosophical schools in late antiquity and have re-\nmained part of the Western tradition. It is still the same tradition,\nthe same intellectual game with paired antitheses that rules, to an\nextent, the famous modern reversals of spiritual hierarchies, such\nas Marx's turning Hegelian dialectic upside down or Nietzsche's\nrevaluation of the sensual and natural as against the supersensual\nand supernatural.\n\nThe reversal we deal with here, the spiritual consequence of\nGalileo's discoveries, although it has frequently been interpreted\nin terms of the traditional reversals and hence as integral to the\nWestern history of ideas, is of an altogether different nature. The\nconviction that objective truth is not given to man but that he can\nknow only what he makes himself is not the result of skepticism\nbut of a demonstrable discovery, and therefore does not lead to\nresignation but either to iv doubled activity or to despair. The\nworld loss of modern philosophy, whose introspection discovered\nconsciousness as the inner sense with which one senses his senses\nand found it to be the only guaranty of reality, is different not only\nin degree from the age-old suspicion of the philosophers toward the\nworld and toward the others with whom they shared the world;\nthe philosopher no longer turns from the world of deceptive perish-\nability to another world of eternal truth, but turns away from both\nand withdraws into himself. What he discovers in the region of the\ninner self is, again, not an image whose permanence can be beheld\nand contemplated, but, on the contrary, the constant movement of\nsensual perceptions and the no less constantly moving activity of\nthe mind. Since the seventeenth century, philosophy has produced\nthe best and least disputed results when it has investigated, through\na supreme effort of self-inspection, the processes of the senses and\nof the mind. In this aspect, most of modern philosophy is indeed\ntheory of cognition and psychology, and in the few instances where\nthe potentialities of the Cartesian method of introspection were\nfully realized by men like Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, one\n\n[ 293 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nis tempted to say that philosophers have experimented with their\nown selves no less radically and perhaps even more fearlessly than\nthe scientists experimented with nature.\n\nMuch as we may admire the courage and respect the extraor-\ndinary ingenuity of philosophers throughout the modern age, it can\nhardly be denied that their influence and importance decreased as\nnever before. It was not in the Middle Ages but in modern thinking\nthat philosophy came to play second and even third fiddle. After\nDescartes based his own philosophy upon the discoveries of Gali-\nleo, philosophy has seemed condemned to be always one step be-\nhind the scientists and their ever more amazing discoveries, whose\nprinciples it has strived arduously to discover ex post facto and to fit\ninto some over-all interpretation of the nature of human knowl-\nedge. As such, however, philosophy was not needed by the scien-\ntists, who — up to our time, at least — believed that they had no use\nfor a handmaiden, let alone one who would “carry the torch in\nfront of her gracious lady” (Kant). The philosophers became\neither epistemologists, worrying about an over-all theory of sci-\nence which the scientists did not need, or they became, indeed,\nwhat Hegel wanted them to be, the organs of the Zeitgeist, the\nmouthpieces in which the general mood of the time was expressed\nwith conceptual clarity. In both instances, whether they looked\nupon nature or upon history, they tried to understand and come to\nterms with what happened without them. Obviously, philosophy\nsuffered more from modernity than any other field of human en-\ndeavor; and it is difficult to say whether it suffered more from the\nalmost automatic rise of activity to an altogether unexpected and\nunprecedented dignity or from the loss of traditional truth, that is,\nof the concept of truth underlying our whole tradition.\n",
        "Section 42. THE REVERSAL WITHIN THE Vita Activa and the victory of Homo Faber": "\nFirst among the activities within the vita activa to rise to the posi-\ntion formerly occupied by contemplation were the activities of\nmaking and fabricating — the prerogatives of homo faber. This was\n\n[ 294 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nnatural enough, since it had been an instrument and therefore man\nin so far as he is a toolmaker that led to the modern revolution.\nFrom then on, all scientific progress has been most intimately tied\nup with the ever more refined development in the manufacture of\nnew tools and instruments. While, for instance, Galileo's experi-\nments with the fall of heavy bodies could have been made at any\ntime in history if men had been inclined to seek truth through ex-\nperiments, Michelson's experiment with the interferometer at the\nend of the nineteenth century relied not merely on his “experi-\nmental genius” but “required the general advance in technology,”\nand therefore “could not have been made earlier than it was .” 59\n\nIt is not only the paraphernalia of instruments and hence the help\nman had to enlist from homofaber to acquire knowledge that caused\nthese activities to rise from their former humble place in the\nhierarchy of human capacities. Even more decisive was the element\nof making and fabricating present in the experiment itself, which\nproduces its own phenomena of observation and therefore depends\nfrom the very outset upon man's productive capacities. The use of\nthe experiment for the purpose of knowledge was already the con-\nsequence of the conviction that one can know only what he has\nmade himself, for this conviction meant that one might learn about\nthose things man did not make by figuring out and imitating the\nprocesses through which they had come into being. The much dis-\ncussed shift of emphasis in the history of science from the old ques-\ntions of “what” or “why” something is to the new question of\n“how” it came into being is a direct consequence of this convic-\ntion, and its answer can only be found in the experiment. The ex-\nperiment repeats the natural process as though man himself were\nabout to make nature's objects, and although in the early stages of\nthe modern age no responsible scientist would have dreamt of the\nextent to which man actually is capable of “making” nature, he\nnevertheless from the onset approached it from the standpoint of\nthe One who made it, and this not for practical reasons of technical\napplicability but exclusively for the “theoretical” reason that cer-\ntainty in knowledge could not be gained otherwise: “Give me\nmatter and I will build a world from it, that is, give me matter and\n\n59. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World , pp. 116-17.\n\n[ 295 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nI will show you how a world developed from it .” 60 These words of\nKant show in a nutshell the modern blending of making and know-\ning, whereby it is as though a few centuries of knowing in the mode\nof making were needed as the apprenticeship to prepare modern\nman for making what he wanted to know.\n\nProductivity and creativity, which were to become the highest\nideals and even the idols of the modern age in its initial stages, are\ninherent standards of homofaber , of man as a builder and fabricator.\nHowever, there is another and perhaps even more significant ele-\nment noticeable in the modern version of these faculties. The shift\nfrom the “why” and “what” to the “how” implies that the actual\nobjects of knowledge can no longer be things or eternal motions\nbut must be processes, and that the object of science therefore is no\nlonger nature or the universe but the history, the story of the com-\ning into being, of nature or life or the universe. Long before the\nmodern age developed its unprecedented historical consciousness\nand the concept of history became dominant in modern philosophy,\nthe natural sciences had developed into historical disciplines, until\nin the nineteenth century they added to the older disciplines of\nphysics and chemistry, of zoology and botany, the new natural\nsciences of geology or history of the earth, biology or the history\nof life, anthropology or the history of human life, and, generally,\nnatural history. In all these instances, development, the key con-\ncept of the historical sciences, became the central concept of the\nphysical sciences as well. Nature, because it could be known only\nin processes which human ingenuity, the ingeniousness of homo\nfaber, could repeat and remake in the experiment, became a proc-\ness , 61 and all particular natural things derived their significance and\nmeaning solely from their functions in the over-all process. In the\nplace of the concept of Being we now find the concept of Process.\nAnd whereas it is in the nature of Being to appear and thus disclose\n\n60. “Gebet mir Materie, ich will eine Welt daraus bauen! das ist, gebet mir\nMaterie, ich will euch zeigen, wie eine Welt daraus entstehen soil” (see Kant's\nPreface to his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels) .\n\n61. That “nature is a process,” that therefore “the ultimate fact for sense-\nawareness is an event,” that natural science deals only with occurrences, hap-\npenings, or events, but not with things and that “apart from happenings there is\nnothing” (see Whitehead, The Concept of Nature, pp. 53, 15, 66), belongs among\nthe axioms of modern natural science in all its branches.\n\n[ 25>6 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nitself, it is in the nature of Process to remain invisible, to be some-\nthing whose existence can only be inferred from the presence of\ncertain phenomena. This process was originally the fabrication\nprocess which “disappears in the product,” and it was based on the\nexperience of homo faber, who knew that a production process\nnecessarily precedes the actual existence of every object.\n\nYet while this insistence on the process of making or the insist-\nence upon considering every thing as the result of a fabrication\nprocess is highly characteristic of homo faber and his sphere of ex-\nperience, the exclusive emphasis the modern age placed on it at the\nexpense of all interest in the things, the products themselves, is\nquite new. It actually transcends the mentality of man as a tool-\nmaker and fabricator, for whom, on the contrary, the production\nprocess was a mere means to an end. Here, from the standpoint of\nhomo faber, it was as though the means, the production process or\ndevelopment, was more important than the end, the finished prod-\nuct. The reason for this shift of emphasis is obvious: the scientist\nmade only in order to know, not in order to produce things, and the\nproduct was a mere by-product, a side effect. Even today all true\nscientists will agree that the technical applicability of what they\nare doing is a mere by-product of their endeavor.\n\nThe full significance of this reversal of means and ends remained\nlatent as long as the mechanistic world view, the world view of homo\nfaber par excellence, was predominant. This view found its most\nplausible theory in the famous analogy of the relationship between\nnature and God with the relationship between the watch and the\nwatchmaker. The point in our context is not so much that the\neighteenth-century idea of God was obviously formed in the image\nof homo faber as that in this instance the process character of nature\nwas still limited. Although all particular natural things had already\nbeen engulfed in the process from which they had come into being,\nnature as a whole was not yet a process but the more or less stable\nend product of a divine maker. The image of watch and watch-\nmaker is so strikingly apposite precisely because it contains both\nthe notion of a process character of nature in the image of the\nmovements of the watch and the notion of its still intact object\ncharacter in the image of the watch itself and its maker.\n\nIt is important at this point to remember that the specifically\n\n[ 297 1\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nmodern suspicion toward man's truth-receiving capacities, the mis-\ntrust of the given, and hence the new confidence in making and\nintrospection which was inspired by the hope that in human con-\nsciousness there was a realm where knowing and producing would\ncoincide, did not arise directly from the discovery of the Archime-\ndean point outside the earth in the universe. They were, rather, the\nnecessary consequences of this discovery for the discoverer him-\nself, in so far as he was and remained an earth-bound creature.\nThis close relationship of the modern mentality with philosophical\nreflection naturally implies that the victory of homo faber could not\nremain restricted to the employment of new methods in the natural\nsciences, the experiment and the mathematization of scientific in-\nquiry. One of the most plausible consequences to be drawn from\nCartesian doubt was to abandon the attempt to understand nature\nand generally to know about things not produced by man, and to\nturn instead exclusively to things that owed their existence to man.\nThis kind of argument, in fact, made Vico turn his attention from\nnatural science to history, which he thought to be the only sphere\nwhere man could obtain certain knowledge, precisely because he\ndealt here only with the products of human activity . 62 The modern\ndiscovery of history and historical consciousness owed one of its\ngreatest impulses neither to a new enthusiasm for the greatness of\nman, his doings and sufferings, nor to the belief that the meaning of\nhuman existence can be found in the story of mankind, but to the\n\n62. Vico (op. cit., ch. 4) states explicitly why he turned away from natural\nscience. True knowledge of nature is impossible, because not man but God made\nit; God can know nature with the same certainty man knows geometry: Geometri-\nca demonstramus quiafacimus; si phy sica demonstrare possemus, facer emus (“We can\nprove geometry because we make it; to prove the physical we would have to\nmake it”). This little treatise, written more than fifteen years before the first\nedition of the Scienza Nuova (1725), is interesting in more than one respect. Vico\ncriticizes all existing sciences, but not yet for the sake of his new science of his-\ntory; what he recommends is the study of moral and political science, which he\nfinds unduly neglected. It must have been much later that the idea occurred to\nhim that history is made by man as nature is made by God. This biographical\ndevelopment, though quite extraordinary in the early eighteenth century, became\nthe rule approximately one hundred years later: each time the modern age had\nreason to hope for a new political philosophy, it received a philosophy of history\ninstead.\n\n\n[ 298 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n\ndespair of human reason, which seemed adequate only when con-\nfronted with man-made objects.\n\nPrior to the modern discovery of history but closely connected\nwith it in its impulses are the seventeenth-century attempts to\nformulate new political philosophies or, rather, to invent the means\nand instruments with which to “make an artificial animal . . .\ncalled a Commonwealth, or State .” 63 With Hobbes as with Des-\ncartes “the prime mover was doubt ,” 64 and the chosen method to\nestablish the “art of man,” by which he would make and rule his\nown world as “God hath made and governs the world” by the art\nof nature, is also introspection, “to read in himself,” since this\nreading will show him “the similitude of the thoughts and passions\nof one man to the thoughts and passions of another.” Here, too, the\nrules and standards by which to build and judge this most human of\nhuman “works of art ” 65 do not lie outside of men, are not some-\nthing men have in common in a worldly reality perceived by the\nsenses or by the mind. They are, rather, inclosed in the inwardness\nof man, open only to introspection, so that their very validity rests\non the assumption that “not . . . the objects of the passions” but\nthe passions themselves are the same in every specimen of the spe-\ncies man-kind Here again we find the image of the watch, this\ntime applied to the human body and then used for the movements\nof the passions. The establishment of the Commonwealth, the\nhuman creation of “an artificial man,” amounts to the building of\nan “automaton [an engine] that moves [itself] by springs and\nwheels as doth a watch.”\n\nIn other words, the process which, as we saw, invaded the natu-\nral sciences through the experiment, through the attempt to imitate\nunder artificial conditions the process of “making” by which a\nnatural thing came into existence, serves as well or even better as\nthe principle for doing in the realm of human affairs. For here the\nprocesses of inner life, found in the passions through introspection,\ncan become the standards and rules for the creation of the “auto-\n\n63.

Ibid.., p. lxiv.\n\n\n[ 299 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nmade” life of that “artificial man” who is “the great Leviathan.”\nThe results yielded by introspection, the only method likely to\ndeliver certain knowledge, are in the nature of movements: only\nthe objects of the senses remain as they are and endure, precede\nand survive, the act of sensation; only the objects of the passions\nare permanent and fixed to the extent that they are not devoured by\nthe attainment of some passionate desire; only the objects of\nthoughts, but never thinking itself, are beyond motion and perish-\nability. Processes, therefore, and not ideas, the models and shapes\nof the things to be, become the guide for the making and fabricating\nactivities of homo faber in the modem age.\n\nHobbes's attempt to introduce the new concepts of making and\nreckoning into political philosophy— or, rather, his attempt to\napply the newly discovered aptitudes of making to the realm of\nhuman affairs — was of the greatest importance; modern rational-\nism as it is currently known, with the assumed antagonism of rea-\nson and passion as its stock-in-trade, has never found a clearer and\nmore uncompromising representative. Yet it was precisely the\nrealm of human affairs where the new philosophy was first found\nwanting, because by its very nature it could not understand or even\nbelieve in reality. The idea that only what I am going to make will\nbe real — perfectly true and legitimate in the realm of fabrication —\nis forever defeated by the actual course of events, where nothing\nhappens more frequently than the totally unexpected. To act in the\nform of making, to reason in the form of “reckoning with conse-\nquences,” means to leave out the unexpected, the event itself, since\nit would be unreasonable or irrational to expect what is no more\nthan an “infinite improbability.” Since, however, the event con-\nstitutes the very texture of reality within the realm of human af-\nfairs, where the “wholly improbable happens regularly,” it is\nhighly unrealistic not to reckon with it, that is, not to reckon with\nsomething with which nobody can safely reckon. The political\nphilosophy of the modern age, whose greatest representative is still\nHobbes, founders on the perplexity that modern rationalism is\nunreal and modern realism is irrational — which is only another way\nof saying that reality and human reason have parted company.\nHegel's gigantic enterprise to reconcile spirit with reality ( den\nGeist mit der Wirklichkeit zu versohnen ), a reconciliation that is the\n\n[ 300 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n\ndeepest concern of all modern theories of history, rested on the\ninsight that modern reason foundered on the rock of reality.\n\nThe fact that modem world alienation was radical enough to\nextend even to the most worldly of human activities, to work and\nreification, the making of things and the building of a world, dis-\ntinguishes modern attitudes and evaluations even more sharply\nfrom those of tradition than a mere reversal of contemplation and\naction, of thinking and doing, would indicate. The break with con-\ntemplation was consummated not with the elevation of man the\nmaker to the position formerly held by man the contemplator, but\nwith the introduction of the concept of process into making. Com-\npared with this, the striking new arrangement of hierarchical order\nwithin the vita activa , where fabrication now came to occupy a rank\nformerly held by political action, is of minor importance. We saw\nbefore that this hierarchy had in fact, though not expressly, already\nbeen overruled in the very beginnings of political philosophy by\nthe philosophers' deep-rooted suspicion of politics in general and\naction in particular.\n\nThe matter is somewhat confused because Greek political phi-\nlosophy still follows the order laid down by the polis even when it\nturns against it; but in their strictly philosophical writings (to\nwhich, of course, one must turn if he wants to know their inner-\nmost thoughts), Plato as well as Aristotle tends to invert the rela-\ntionship between work and action in favor of work. Thus Aris-\ntotle, in a discussion of the different kinds of cognition in his\nMetaphysics , places dianoia and episteme praktike, practical insight\nand political science, at the lowest rank of his order, and puts\nabove them the science of fabrication, episteme poietike, which im-\nmediately precedes and leads to thedria, the contemplation of\ntruth . 66 And the reason for this predilection in philosophy is by no\nmeans the politically inspired suspicion of action which we men-\ntioned before, but the philosophically much more compelling one\nthat contemplation and fabrication ( thedria and poiesis ) have an\ninner affinity and do not stand in the same unequivocal opposition\nto each other as contemplation and action. The decisive point of\nsimilarity, at least in Greek philosophy, was that contemplation,\nthe beholding of something, was considered to be an inherent ele-\n\n66. Metaphysics 1025b25 ff., 1064al7 ff.\n\n[ 301 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nment in fabrication as well, inasmuch as the work of the craftsman\nwas guided by the “idea,” the model beheld by him before the\nfabrication process had started as well as after it had ended, first\nto tell him what to make and then to enable him to judge the\nfinished product.\n\nHistorically, the source of this contemplation, which we find for\nthe first time described in the Socratic school, is at least twofold.\nOn one hand, it stands in obvious and consistent connection with\nthe famous contention of Plato, quoted by Aristotle, that thauma-\nzein, the shocked wonder at the miracle of Being, is the beginning\nof all philosophy . 67 It seems to me highly probable that this Pla-\ntonic contention is the immediate result of an experience, perhaps\nthe most striking one, that Socrates offered his disciples: the sight\nof him time and again suddenly overcome by his thoughts and\nthrown into a state of absorption to the point of perfect motionless-\nness for many hours. It seems no less plausible that this shocked\nwonder should be essentially speechless, that is, that its actual con-\ntent should be untranslatable into words. This, at least, would ex-\nplain why Plato and Aristotle, who held thaumazein to be the be-\nginning of philosophy, should also agree — despite so many and\nsuch decisive disagreements — that some state of speechlessness,\nthe essentially speechless state of contemplation, was the end of\nphilosophy. Thedria, in fact, is only another word for thaumazein;\nthe contemplation of truth at which the philosopher ultimately ar-\nrives is the philosophically purified speechless wonder with which\nhe began.\n\nThere is, however, another side to this matter, which shows it-\nself most articulately in Plato's doctrine of ideas, in its content as\nwell as in its terminology and exemplifications. These reside in the\nexperiences of the craftsman, who sees before his inner eye the\nshape of the model according to which he fabricates his object. To\n\n67. For Plato see Theaetetus 155: Mala gar philosophm touto to pathos, to\nthaumazein ; ou gar alle archie philosophias e haute (“For wonder is what the philoso-\npher endures most; for there is no other beginning of philosophy than this”).\nAristotle, who at the beginning of the Metaphysics (982bl2 IF.) seems to repeat\nPlato almost verbatim — “For it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin\nand at first began to philosophize” — actually uses this wonder in an altogether\ndifferent way; to him, the actual impulse to philosophize lies in the desire “to\nescape ignorance.”\n\n\n[ 302 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nPlato, this model, which craftsmanship can only imitate but not\ncreate, is no product of the human mind but given to it. As such it\npossesses a degree of permanence and excellence which is not ac-\ntualized but on the contrary spoiled in its materialization through\nthe work of human hands. Work makes perishable and spoils the\nexcellence of what remained eternal so long as it was the object of\nmere contemplation. Therefore, the proper attitude toward the\nmodels which guide work and fabrication, that is, toward Platonic\nideas, is to leave them as they are and appear to the inner eye of the\nmind. If man only renounces his capacity for work and does not do\nanything, he can behold them and thus participate in their eternity.\nContemplation, in this respect, is quite unlike the enraptured state\nof wonder with which man responds to the miracle of Being as a\nwhole. It is and remains part and parcel of a fabrication process\neven though it has divorced itself from all work and all doing; in it,\nthe beholding of the model, which now no longer is to guide any\ndoing, is prolonged and enjoyed for its own sake.\n\nIn the tradition of philosophy, it is this second kind of contem-\nplation that became the predominant one. Therefore the motion-\nlessness which in the state of speechless wonder is no more than an\nincidental, unintended result of absorption, becomes now the con-\ndition and hence the outstanding characteristic of the vita con-\ntemplativa. It is not wonder that overcomes and throws man into\nmotionlessness, but it is through the conscious cessation of activ-\nity, the activity of making, that the contemplative state is reached.\nIf one reads medieval sources on the joys and delights of contem-\nplation, it is as though the philosophers wanted to make sure that\nhomo faber would heed the call and let his arms drop, finally realiz-\ning that his greatest desire, the desire for permanence and immor-\ntality, cannot be fulfilled by his doings, but only when he realizes\nthat the beautiful and eternal cannot be made. In Plato's philoso-\nphy, speechless wonder, the beginning and the end of philosophy,\ntogether with the philosopher's love for the eternal and the crafts-\nman's desire for permanence and immortality, permeate each other\nuntil they are almost indistinguishable. Yet the very fact that the\nphilosophers' speechless wonder seemed to be an experience re-\nserved for the few, while the craftsmen's contemplative glance was\n\n[ 303 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nknown by many, weighed heavily in favor of a contemplation pri-\nmarily derived from the experiences of homo faber. It already\nweighed heavily with Plato, who drew his examples from the realm\nof making because they were closer to a more general human ex-\nperience, and it weighed even more heavily where some kind of\ncontemplation and meditation was required of everybody, as in\nmedieval Christianity.\n\nThus it was not primarily the philosopher and philosophic\nspeechless wonder that molded the concept and practice of con-\ntemplation and the vita contemplative but rather homo faber in dis-\nguise; it was man the maker and fabricator, whose job it is to do\nviolence to nature in order to build a permanent home for himself,\nand who now was persuaded to renounce violence together with\nall activity, to leave things as they are, and to find his home in the\ncontemplative dwelling in the neighborhood of the imperishable\nand eternal. Homo faber could be persuaded to this change of atti-\ntude because he knew contemplation and some of its delights from\nhis own experience; he did not need a complete change of heart, a\ntrue periagoge, a radical turnabout. All he had to do was let his\narms drop and prolong indefinitely the act of beholding the eidos,\nthe eternal shape and model he had formerly wanted to imitate and\nwhose excellence and beauty he now knew he could only spoil\nthrough any attempt at reification.\n\nIf, therefore, the modern challenge to the priority of contempla-\ntion over every kind of activity had done no more than turn upside\ndown the established order between making and beholding, it\nwould still have remained in the traditional framework. This\nframework was forced wide open, however, when in the under-\nstanding of fabrication itself the emphasis shifted entirely away\nfrom the product and from the permanent, guiding model to the\nfabrication process, away from the question of what a thing is and\nwhat kind of thing was to be produced to the question of how and\nthrough which means and processes it had come into being and\ncould be reproduced. For this implied both that contemplation was\nno longer believed to yield truth and that it had lost its position in\nthe vita activa itself and hence within the range of ordinary human\nexperience.\n\n\n[ 304 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\n",
        "Section 43. the defeat of Homo Faber and the PRINCIPLE OF HAPPINESS": "\nIf one considers only the events that led into the modern age and\nreflects solely upon the immediate consequences of Galileo's dis-\ncovery, which must have struck the great minds of the seventeenth\ncentury with the compelling force of self-evident truth, the re-\nversal of contemplation and fabrication, or rather the elimination\nof contemplation from the range of meaningful human capacities,\nis almost a matter of course. It seems equally plausible that this\nreversal should have elevated homojaber , the maker and fabricator,\nrather than man the actor or man as animal laborans, to the highest\nrange of human possibilities.\n\nAnd, indeed, among the outstanding characteristics of the mod-\nern age from its beginning to our own time we find the typical atti-\ntudes of homo faber: his instrumentalization of the world, his con-\nfidence in tools and in the productivity of the maker of artificial\nobjects; his trust in the all-comprehensive range of the means-end\ncategory, his conviction that every issue can be solved and every\nhuman motivation reduced to the principle of utility; his sover-\neignty, which regards everything given as material and thinks of\nthe whole of nature as of “an immense fabric from which we can\ncut out whatever we want to resew it however we like ”; 68 his\nequation of intelligence with ingenuity, that is, his contempt for all\n\n68. Henri Bergson, Evolution creatrice (1948), p. 157. An analysis of Bergson's\nposition in modern philosophy would lead us too far afield. But his insistence on\nthe priority of homo faber over homo sapiens and on fabrication as the source of\nhuman intelligence, as well as his emphatic opposition of life to intelligence, is\nvery suggestive. Bergson's philosophy could easily be read like a case study of\nhow the modern age's earlier conviction of the relative superiority of making over\nthinking was then superseded and annihilated by its more recent conviction of an\nabsolute superiority of life over everything else. It is because Bergson himself still\nunited both of these elements that he could exert such a decisive influence on the\nbeginnings of labor theories in France. Not only the earlier works of Edouard\nBerth and Georges Sorel, but also Adriano Tilgher's Homo faber (1929), owe\ntheir terminology chiefly to Bergson; this is still true of Jules Vuillemin's L'hre\net le travail (1949), although Vuillemin, like almost every present-day French\nwriter, thinks primarily in Hegelian terms.\n\n[ m \\\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nthought which cannot be considered to be “the first step ... for\nthe fabrication of artificial objects, particularly of tools to make\ntools, and to vary their fabrication indefinitely ”; 89 finally, his\nmatter-of-course identification of fabrication with action.\n\nIt would lead us too far afield to follow the ramifications of this\nmentality, and it is not necessary, for they are easily detected in\nthe natural sciences, where the purely theoretical effort is under-\nstood to spring from the desire to create order out of “mere dis-\norder,” the “wild variety of nature ,” 70 and where therefore homo\nfaber' s predilection for patterns for things to be produced replaces\nthe older notions of harmony and simplicity. It can be found in\nclassical economics, whose highest standard is productivity and\nwhose prejudice against non-productive activities is so strong that\neven Marx could justify his plea for justice for laborers only by\nmisrepresenting the laboring, non-productive activity in terms of\nwork and fabrication. It is most articulate, of course, in the prag-\nmatic trends of modern philosophy, which are not only character-\nized by Cartesian world alienation but also by the unanimity with\nwhich English philosophy from the seventeenth century onward\nand French philosophy in the eighteenth century adopted the prin-\nciple of utility as the key which would open all doors to the ex-\nplanation of human motivation and behavior. Generally speaking,\nthe oldest conviction of hmno faber — that “man is the measure of\nall things” — advanced to the rank of a universally accepted com-\nmonplace.\n\nWhat needs explanation is not the modern esteem of homo faber\nbut the fact that this esteem was so quickly followed by the eleva-\ntion of laboring to the highest position in the hierarchical order of\nthe vita activa. This second reversal of hierarchy within the vita\nactiva came about more gradually and less dramatically than either\nthe reversal of contemplation and action in general or the reversal\nof action and fabrication in particular. The elevation of laboring\nwas preceded by certain deviations and variations from the tradi-\ntional mentality of homo faber which were highly characteristic of\nthe modern age and which, indeed, arose almost automatically\nfrom the very nature of the events that ushered it in. What changed\n\n69. Bergson, op. cit., p. 140.\n\n70. Bronowski, op. cit.\n\n\n[ 306 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthe mentality of homo faber was the central position of the concept\nof process in modernity. As far as homo faber was concerned, the\nmodern shift of emphasis from the “what\" to the “how,” from the\nthing itself to its fabrication process, was by no means an unmixed\nblessing. It deprived man as maker and builder of those fixed and\npermanent standards and measurements which, prior to the modern\nage, have always served him as guides for his doing and criteria for\nhis judgment. It is not only and perhaps not even primarily the de-\nvelopment of commercial society that, with the triumphal victory\nof exchange value over use value, first introduced the principle of\ninterchangeability, then the relativization, and finally the devalua-\ntion, of all values. For the mentality of modern man, as it was de-\ntermined by the development of modern science and the concomi-\ntant unfolding of modern philosophy, it was at least as decisive\nthat man began to consider himself part and parcel of the two su-\nperhuman, all-encompassing processes of nature and history, both\nof which seemed doomed to an infinite progress without ever\nreaching any inherent telos or approaching any preordained idea.\n\nHomo faber, in other words, as he arose from the great revolution\nof modernity, though he was to acquire an undreamed-of ingenuity\nin devising instruments to measure the infinitely large and the in-\nfinitely small, was deprived of those permanent measures that pre-\ncede and outlast the fabrication process and form an authentic and\nreliable absolute with respect to the fabricating activity. Certainly,\nnone of the activities of the vita activa stood to lose as much through\nthe elimination of contemplation from the range of meaningful hu-\nman capacities as fabrication. For unlike action, which partly con-\nsists in the unchaining of processes, and unlike laboring, which fol-\nlows closely the metabolic process of biological life, fabrication\nexperiences processes, if it is aware of them at all, as mere means\ntoward an end, that is, as something secondary and derivative. No\nother capacity, moreover, stood to lose as much through modern\nworld alienation and the elevation of introspection into an omnip-\notent device to conquer nature as those faculties which are pri-\nmarily directed toward the building of the world and the produc-\ntion of worldly things.\n\nNothing perhaps indicates clearer the ultimate failure of homo\nfaber to assert himself than the rapidity with which the principle of\n\n[ 307 ]\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nutility, the very quintessence of his world view, was found want-\ning and was superseded by the principle of “the greatest happiness\nof the greatest number .” 71 When this happened it was manifest\nthat the conviction of the age that man can know only what he\nmakes himself — which seemingly was so eminently propitious to a\nfull victory of homo faber — would be overruled and eventually de-\nstroyed by the even more modern principle of process, whose con-\ncepts and categories are altogether alien to the needs and ideals of\nhomo faber. For the principle of utility, though its point of reference\nis clearly man, who uses matter to produce things, still presup-\nposes a world of use objects by which man is surrounded and in\nwhich he moves. If this relationship between man and world is no\nlonger secure, if worldly things are no longer primarily considered\nin their usefulness but as more or less incidental results of the pro-\nduction process which brought them into being, so that the end\nproduct of the production process is no longer a true end and the\nproduced thing is valued not for the sake of its predetermined\nusage but “for its production of something else,” then, obviously,\nthe objection can be “raised that ... its value is secondary only,\nand a world that contains no primary values can contain no second-\nary ones either .” 72 This radical loss of values within the restricted\n\n7 1 . Jeremy Bentham's formula in An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation (1789) was “suggested to him by Joseph Priestley and closely re-\nsembled Beccaria's la massima felicith divisa nel maggior numero ” (Introduction to\nthe Hafher edition by Laurence J. Lafleur). According to flic Halevy ( The\nGrowth of Philosophic Radicalism [Beacon Press, 1955]), both Beccaria and Ben-\ntham were indebted to Helvetius' De 1' esprit.\n\n72. Lafleur, op. cit., p. xi. Bentham himself expresses his dissatisfaction with a\nmerely utilitarian philosophy in the note added to a late edition of his work\n(Hafner ed., p. 1) : “The word utility does not so clearly point to the ideas of\npleasure and pain as the words happiness and felicity do.” His chief objection is that\nutility is not measurable and therefore does not “lead us to the consideration of\nthe number ,” without which a “formation of the standard of right and wrong”\nwould not be possible. Bentham derives his happiness principle from the utility\nprinciple by divorcing the concept of utility from the notion of usage (see ch. 1,\npar. 3). This separation marks a turning point in the history of utilitarianism.\nFor while it is true that the utility principle had been related primarily to the ego\nprior to Bentham, it is only Bentham who radically emptied the idea of utility of\nall reference to an independent world of use things and thus transformed utilitari-\nanism into a truly “universalized egoism” (Hal£vy).\n\n[ 308 }\n\n\n\nframe of reference of homo faber himself occurs almost automati-\ncally as soon as he defines himself not as the maker of objects and\nthe builder of the human artifice who incidentally invents tools,\nbut considers himself primarily a toolmaker and “particularly [a\nmaker] of tools to make tools” who only incidentally also pro-\nduces things. If one applies the principle of utility in this context at\nall, then it refers primarily not to use objects and not to usage but\nto the production process. Now what helps stimulate productivity\nand lessens pain and effort is useful. In other words, the ultimate\nstandard of measurement is not utility and usage at all, but “happi-\nness,” that is, the amount of pain and pleasure experienced in the\nproduction or in the consumption of things.\n\nBentham's invention of the “pain and pleasure calculus” com-\nbined the advantage of seemingly introducing the mathematical\nmethod into the moral sciences with the even greater attraction of\nhaving found a principle which resided entirely on introspection.\nHis “happiness,” the sum total of pleasures minus pains, is as much\nan inner sense which senses sensations and remains unrelated to\nworldly objects as the Cartesian consciousness that is conscious of\nits own activity. Moreover, Bentham's basic assumption that what\nall men have in common is not the world but the sameness of their\nown nature, which manifests itself in the sameness of calculation\nand the sameness of being affected by pain and pleasure, is directly\nderived from the earlier philosophers of the modern age. For this\nphilosophy, “hedonism” is even more of a misnomer than for the\nepicureanism of late antiquity, to which modern hedonism is only\nsuperficially related. The principle of all hedonism, as we saw\nbefore, is not pleasure but avoidance of pain, and Hume, who in\ncontradistinction to Bentham was still a philosopher, knew quite\nwell that he who wants to make pleasure the ultimate end of all\nhuman action is driven to admit that not pleasure but pain, not\ndesire but fear, are his true guides. “If you . . . inquire, why\n[somebody] desires health, he will readily reply, because sickness\nis painful. If you push your inquiries further and desire a reason\nwhy he hates pain, it is impossible he can ever give any. This is an\nultimate end, and is never referred to by any other object .” 73 The\nreason for this impossibility is that only pain is completely inde-\n\n73. Quoted from Halevy, op. cit., p. 13.\n\n[ 309 )\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\npendent of any object, that only one who is in pain really senses\nnothing but himself; pleasure does not enjoy itself but something\nbesides itself. Pain is the only inner sense found by introspection\nwhich can rival in independence from experienced objects the self-\nevident certainty of logical and arithmetical reasoning.\n\nWhile this ultimate foundation of hedonism in the experience of\npain is true for both its ancient and modern varieties, in the modern\nage it acquires an altogether different and much stronger emphasis.\nFor here it is by no means the world, as in antiquity, that drives\nman into himself to escape the pains it may inflict, under which\ncircumstance both pain and pleasure still retain a good deal of their\nworldly significance. Ancient world alienation in all its varieties —\nfrom stoicism to epicureanism down to hedonism and cynicism —\nhad been inspired by a deep mistrust of the world and moved by a\nvehement impulse to withdraw from worldly involvement, from\nthe trouble and pain it inflicts, into the security of an inward realm\nin which the self is exposed to nothing but itself. Their moderr\ncounterparts — puritanism, sensualism, and Bentham's hedonism —\non the contrary, were inspired by an equally deep mistrust of man\nas such; they were moved by doubt of the adequacy of the human\nsenses to receive reality, the adequacy of human reason to receive\ntruth, and hence by the conviction of the deficiency or even deprav-\nity of human nature.\n\nThis depravity is not Christian or biblical either in origin or in\ncontent, although it was of course interpreted in terms of original\nsin, and it is difficult to say whether it is more harmful and repul-\nsive when puritans denounce man's corruptness or when Bentham-\nites brazenly hail as virtues what men always have known to be\nvices. While the ancients had relied upon imagination and memory,\nthe imagination of pains from which they were free or the memory\nof past pleasures in situations of acute painfulness, to convince\nthemselves of their happiness, the moderns needed the calculus of\npleasure or the puritan moral bookkeeping of merits and transgres-\nsions to arrive at some illusory mathematical certainty of happiness\nor salvation. (These moral arithmetics are, of course, quite alien\nto the spirit pervading the philosophic schools of late antiquity.\nMoreover, one need only reflect on the rigidity of self-imposed\ndiscipline and the concomitant nobility of character, so manifest in\n\n[ 310 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthose who had been formed by ancient stoicism or epicureanism, to\nbecome aware of the gulf by which these versions of hedonism are\nseparated from modern puritanism, sensualism, and hedonism. For\nthis difference, it is almost irrelevant whether the modern character\nis still formed by the older narrow-minded, fanatic self-righteous-\nness or has yielded to the more recent self-centered and self-\nindulgent egotism with its infinite variety of futile miseries.) It\nseems more than doubtful that the “greatest happiness principle”\nwould have achieved its intellectual triumphs in the English-speak-\ning world if no more had been involved than the questionable discov-\nery that “nature has placed mankind under the governance of two\nsovereign masters, pain and pleasure,” 74 or the absurd idea of estab-\nlishing morals as an exact science by isolating “in the human soul\nthat feeling which seems to be the most easily measurable.” 76\n\nHidden behind this as behind other, less interesting variations of\nthe sacredness of egoism and the all-pervasive power of self-inter-\nest, which were current to the point of being commonplace in the\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, we find another point of\nreference which indeed forms a much more potent principle than\nany pain-pleasure calculus could ever offer, and that is the principle\nof life itself. What pain and pleasure, fear and desire, are actually\nsupposed to achieve in all these systems is not happiness at all but\nthe promotion of individual life or a guaranty of the survival of\nmankind. If modem egoism were the ruthless search for pleasure\n(called happiness) it pretends to be, it would not lack what in all\ntruly hedonistic systems is an indispensable element of argumenta-\ntion — a radical justification of suicide. This lack alone indicates\nthat in fact we deal here with life philosophy in its most vulgar and\nleast critical form. In the last resort, it is always life itself which is\nthe supreme standard to which everything else is referred, and the\n\n74. This, of course, is the first sentence of the Principles of Morals and Legisla-\ntion. The famous sentence is “copied almost word for word from Helvetius”\n(Halevy, op. cit ., p. 26). Halevy rightly remarks that “it was natural that a cur-\nrent idea should on all sides rather tend to find expression in the same formulae' '\n(p. 22) . This fact, incidentally, clearly shows that the authors we deal with here\nare not philosophers; for no matter how current certain ideas might be during a\ngiven period, there never are two philosophers who could arrive at identical\nformulations without copying from each other.\n\n75. Ibid., p. 15.\n\n\n[ 311 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ninterests of the individual as well as the interests of mankind are\nalways equated with individual life or the life of the species as\nthough it were a matter of course that life is the highest good.\n\nThe curious failure of homo faber to assert himself under condi-\ntions seemingly so extraordinarily propitious could also have been\nillustrated by another, philosophically even more relevant, revision\nof basic traditional beliefs. Hume's radical criticism of the causality\nprinciple, which prepared the way for the later adoption of the\nprinciple of evolution, has often been considered one of the origins\nof modern philosophy. The causality principle with its twofold\ncentral axiom — that everything that is must have a cause ( nihil sine\ncausa) and that the cause must be more perfect than its most perfect\neffect — obviously relies entirely on experiences in the realm of\nfabrication, where the maker is superior to his products. Seen in\nthis context, the turning point in the intellectual history of the\nmodern age came when the image of organic life development—\nwhere the evolution of a lower being, for instance the ape, can\ncause the appearance of a higher being, for instance man — appeared\nin the place of the image of the watchmaker who must be superior\nto all watches whose cause he is.\n\nMuch more is implied in this change than the mere denial of the\nlifeless rigidity of a mechanistic world view. It is as though in the\nlatent seventeenth-century conflict between the two possible meth-\nods to be derived from the Galilean discovery, the method of the\nexperiment and of making on one hand and the method of introspec-\ntion on the other, the latter was to achieve a somewhat belated\nvictory. For the only tangible object introspection yields, if it is to\nyield more than an entirely empty consciousness of itself, is indeed\nthe biological process. And since this biological life, accessible in\nself-observation, is at the same time a metabolic process between\nman and nature, it is as though introspection no longer needs to get\nlost in the ramifications of a consciousness without reality, but has\nfound within man — not in his mind but in his bodily processes —\nenough outside matter to connect him again with the outer world.\nThe split between subject and object, inherent in human conscious-\nness and irremediable in the Cartesian opposition of man as a res\ncogitans to a surrounding world of res extensae, disappears altogether\nin the case of a living organism, whose very survival depends upon\n\n[ 312 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthe incorporation, the consumption, of outside matter.

        "Section 44. LIFE AS THE HIGHEST GOOD": "\nTempting as it may be for the sake of sheer consistency to derive\nthe modern life concept from the self-inflicted perplexities of mod-\nern philosophy, it would be a delusion and a grave injustice to the\nseriousness of the problems of the modern age if one looked upon\nthem merely from the viewpoint of the development of ideas. The\ndefeat of homo faber may be explainable in terms of the initial trans-\nformation of physics into astrophysics, of natural sciences into a\n“universal” science. What still remains to be explained is why this\ndefeat ended with a victory of the animal laborans; why, with the\nrise of the vita activa, it was precisely the laboring activity that was\nto be elevated to the highest rank of man's capacities or, to put it\nanother way, why within the diversity of the human condition\nwith its various human capacities it was precisely life that over-\nruled all other considerations.\n\nThe reason why life asserted itself as the ultimate point of refer-\nence in the modern age and has remained the highest good of mod-\n\n76. The greatest representatives of modem life philosophy are Marx, Nietz-\nsche, and Bergson, inasmuch as all three equate Life and Being. For this equation,\nthey rely on introspection, and life is indeed the only “being” man can possibly\nbe aware of by looking merely into himself. The difference between these and the\nearlier philosophers of the modern age is that life appears to be more active and\nmore productive than consciousness, which seems to be still too closely related\nto contemplation and the old ideal of truth. This last stage of modem philosophy\nis perhaps best described as the rebellion of the philosophers against philosophy, a\nrebellion which, beginning with Kierkegaard and ending in existentialism, appears\nat first glance to emphasize action as against contemplation. Upon closer inspec-\ntion, however, none of these philosophers is actually concerned with action as\nsuch. We may leave aside here Kierkegaard and his non-worldly, inward-directed\nacting. Nietzsche and Bergson describe action in terms of fabrication —homo faber\ninstead of homo sapiens — just as Marx thinks of acting in terms of making and\ndescribes labor in terms of work. But their ultimate point of reference is not work\nand worldliness any more than action; it is life and life's fertility.\n\n[ 313 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nern society is that the modern reversal operated within the fabric\nof a Christian society whose fundamental belief in the sacredness of\nlife has survived, and has even remained completely unshaken by,\nsecularization and the general decline of the Christian faith. In\nother words, the modern reversal followed and left unchallenged\nthe most important reversal with which Christianity had broken\ninto the ancient world, a reversal that was politically even more\nfar-reaching and, historically at any rate, more enduring than any\nspecific dogmatic content or belief. For the Christian “glad tid-\nings” of the immortality of individual human life had reversed the\nancient relationship between man and world and promoted the most\nmortal thing, human life, to the position of immortality, which up\nto then the cosmos had held.\n\nHistorically, it is more than probable that the victory of the\nChristian faith in the ancient world was largely due to this re-\nversal, which brought hope to those who knew that their world\nwas doomed, indeed a hope beyond hope, since the new message\npromised an immortality they never had dared to hope for. This\nreversal could not but be disastrous for the esteem and the dignity\nof politics. Political activity, which up to then had derived its great-\nest inspiration from the aspiration toward worldly immortality,\nnow sank to the low level of an activity subject to necessity,\ndestined to remedy the consequences of human sinfulness on one\nhand and to cater to the legitimate wants and interests of earthly\nlife on the other. Aspiration toward immortality could now only\nbe equated with vainglory; such fame as the world could bestow\nupon man was an illusion, since the world was even more perish-\nable than man, and a striving for worldly immortality was mean-\ningless, since life itself was immortal.\n\nIt is precisely individual life which now came to occupy the\nposition once held by the “life” of the body politic, and Paul's\nstatement that “death is the wages of sin,” since life is meant to\nlast forever, echoes Cicero's statement that death is the reward of\nsins committed by political communities which were built to last\nfor eternity . 77 It is as though the early Christians — at least Paul,\n\n77. Cicero's remark: Civitatibus autem mors ipsa poena est . . . debet enim consti-\ntuta sic esse civitas utaeterna sit ( De republica iii. 23) . For the conviction in antiquity\nthat a well-founded body politic should be immortal, see also Plato, Laws 713,\n\n[ 314 ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nwho after all was a Roman citizen — consciously shaped their con-\ncept of immortality after the Roman model, substituting individual\nlife for the political life of the body politic. Just as the body politic\npossesses only a potential immortality which can be forfeited by\npolitical transgressions, individual life had once forfeited its guar-\nanteed immortality in Adam's fall and now, through Christ, had\nregained a new, potentially everlasting life which, however, could\nagain be lost in a second death through individual sin.\n\nCertainly, Christian emphasis on the sacredness of life is part\nand parcel of the Hebrew heritage, which already presented a strik-\ning contrast to the attitudes of antiquity: the pagan contempt for\nthe hardships which life imposes upon man in labor and giving birth,\nthe envious picture of the “easy life” of the gods, the custom of\nexposing unwanted offspring, the conviction that life without\nhealth is not worth living (so that the physician, for instance, is\nheld to have misunderstood his calling when he prolongs life where\nhe cannot restore health ) 78 and that suicide is a noble gesture to\nescape a life that has become burdensome. Still, one need only re-\nmember how the Decalogue enumerates the offense of murder,\nwithout any special emphasis, among a number of other transgres-\nsions — which to our way of thinking can hardly compete in gravity\nwith this supreme crime — to realize that not even the Hebrew\nlegal code, though much closer to our own than any pagan scale of\noffenses, made the preservation of life the cornerstone of the legal\nsystem of the Jewish people. This intermediary position which the\nHebrew legal code occupies between pagan antiquity and all Chris-\ntian or post-Christian legal systems may be explicable by the\nHebrew creed which stresses the potential immortality of the\npeople, as distinguished from the pagan immortality of the world\non one side and the Christian immortality of individual life on the\nother. At any event, this Christian immortality that is bestowed\nupon the person, who in his uniqueness begins life by birth on\nearth, resulted not only in the more obvious increase of other-\nworldliness, but also in an enormously increased importance of life\n\n\nwhere the founders of a new polis are told to imitate the immortal part in man\n(hoson en hemin athanasias enest ) .\n\n78. See Plato Republic 405C.\n\n\n[ 315 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\non earth. The point is that Christianity — except for heretical and\ngnostic speculations — always insisted that life, though it had no\nlonger a final end, still has a definite beginning. Life on earth may\nbe only the first and the most miserable stage of eternal life; it still\nis life, and without this life that will be terminated in death, there\ncannot be eternal life. This may be the reason for the undisputable\nfact that only when the immortality of individual life became the\ncentral creed of Western mankind, that is, only with the rise of\nChristianity, did life on earth also become the highest good of man.\n\nChristian emphasis on the sacredness of life tended to level out\nthe ancient distinctions and articulations within the vita activa; it\ntended to view labor, work, and action as equally subject to the\nnecessity of present life. At the same time it helped to free the\nlaboring activity, that is, whatever is necessary to sustain the bio-\nlogical process itself, from some of the contempt in which antiq-\nuity had held it. The old contempt toward the slave, who had been\ndespised because he served only life's necessities and submitted to\nthe compulsion of his master because he wanted to stay alive at all\ncosts, could not possibly survive in the Christian era. One could no\nlonger with Plato despise the slave for not having committed sui-\ncide rather than submit to a master, for to stay alive under all cir-\ncumstances had become a holy duty, and suicide was regarded as\nworse than murder. Not the murderer, but he who had put an end\nto his own life was refused a Christian burial.\n\nYet contrary to what some modern interpreters have tried to\nread into Christian sources, there are no indications of the modern\nglorification of laboring in the New Testament or in other pre-\nmodern Christian writers. Paul, who has been called “the apostle\nof labor ,” 79 was nothing of the sort, and the few passages on which\n\n79. By the Dominican Bernard Alio, Le travail d'apres St. Paul (1914) . Among\nthe defenders of the Christian origin of modern glorification of labor are: in\nFrance, fitienne Borne and Francois Henry, Le travail et I'homme (1937); in\nGermany, Karl Muller, Die Arbeit: Nach moral-philosophischen Grundsdtzen des\nheiligen Thomas van Aquino (1912). More recently, Jacques Leclercq from Lou-\nvain, who has contributed one of the most valuable and interesting works to the\nphilosophy of labor in the fourth book of his Lefons de droit naturel, entitled\nTravail, propriete (1946), has rectified this misinterpretation of the Christian\nsources: “Le christianisme n'a pas change grand'chose a l'estime du travail”;\n\n[ 316 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthis claim is based either are addressed to those who out of laziness\n“ate other men's bread” or they recommend labor as a good means\nto keep out of trouble, that is, they reinforce the general prescrip-\ntion of a strictly private life and warn of political activities . 80 It is\neven more relevant that in later Christian philosophy, and particu-\nlarly in Thomas Aquinas, labor had become a duty for those who\nhad no other means to keep alive, the duty consisting in keeping\none's self alive and not in laboring; if one could provide for himself\nthrough beggary, so much the better. Whoever reads the sources\nwithout modern prolabor prejudices will be surprised at how little\nthe church fathers availed themselves even of the obvious oppor-\ntunity to justify labor as punishment for original sin. Thus Thomas\ndoes not hesitate to follow Aristotle rather than the Bible in this\nquestion and to assert that “only the necessity to keep alive com-\npels to do manual labor .” 81 Labor to him is nature's way of keeping\nthe human species alive, and from this he concludes that it is by no\nmeans necessary that all men earn their bread by the sweat of their\nbrows, but that this is rather a kind of last and desperate resort to\nsolve the problem or fulfil the duty . 82 Not even the use of labor as a\nmeans with which to ward off the dangers of otiosity is a new\nChristian discovery, but was already a commonplace of Roman\nmorality. In complete agreement with ancient convictions about\nthe character of the laboring activity, finally, is the frequent Chris-\ntian use for the mortification of the flesh, where labor, especially in\nthe monasteries, sometimes played the same role as other painful\nexercises and forms of self-torture . 83\n\n\nand in Aquinas' work “la notion du travail n'apparait que fort accidentellement”\n\n(pp. 61-62).\n\n80. See I Thess. 4:9-12 and II Thess. 3 : 8-12.\n\n81. Summa contra Gentiles iii. 135: Sola enim necessitas victus cogit manibus\noperari.\n\n82. Summa theologica ii. 2. 187. 3, 5.\n\n83. In the monastic rules, particularly in the ora et labora of Benedict, labor is\nrecommended against the temptations of an idle body (see ch. 48 of the rule).\nIn the so-called rule of Augustine ( Epistolae 211), labor is considered to be a law\nof nature, not a punishment for sin. Augustine recommends manual labor — he\nuses the words opera and labor synonymously as the opposite of otium — for three\n\n[ m }\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nThe reason why Christianity, its insistence on the sacredness of\nlife and on the duty to stay alive notwithstanding, never developed\na positive labor philosophy lies in the unquestioned priority given\nto the vita contemplativa over all kinds of human activities. Vita\ncontemplativct simpliciter melior est quam vita activa (“the life of con-\ntemplation is simply better than the life of action”), and what-\never the merits of an active life might be, those of a life devoted to\ncontemplation are “more effective and more powerful .” 84 This\nconviction, it is true, can hardly be found in the preachings of Jesus\nof Nazareth, and it is certainly due to the influence of Greek phi-\nlosophy; yet even if medieval philosophy had kept closer to the\nspirit of the Gospels, it could hardly have found there any reason\nfor a glorification of laboring . 86 The only activity Jesus of Nazareth\nrecommends in his preachings is action, and the only human capac-\nity he stresses is the capacity “to perform miracles.”\n\nHowever that may be, the modern age continued to operate un-\nder the assumption that life, and not the world, is the highest good\nof man; in its boldest and most radical revisions and criticisms of\ntraditional beliefs and concepts, it never even thought of challeng-\ning this fundamental reversal which Christianity had brought into\n\nreasons: it helps to fight the temptations of otiosity; it helps the monasteries to\nfulfil their duty of charity toward the poor; and it is favorable to contemplation\nbecause it does not engage the mind unduly like other occupations, for instance,\nthe buying and selling of goods. For the role of labor in the monasteries, compare\nEtienne Delaruelle, “Le travail dans les regies monastiques occidentales du 4e au\n9e siecle,” Journal de psychologic normale et pathologique, Vol. XLI, No. 1 (1948).\nApart from these formal considerations, it is quite characteristic that the Solitaires\nde Port-Royal, looking for some instrument of really effective punishment,\nthought immediately of labor (see Lucien Febre, “Travail: Evolution d'un mot et\nd'une idee,” Journal de psychologic normale et pathologique, Vol. XLI, No. 1 [1948]) .\n\n84. Aquinas Summa theologka ii. 2. 182. 1, 2. In his insistence on the absolute\nsuperiority of the vita contemplativa, Thomas shows a characteristic difference\nfrom Augustine, who recommends the inquisitio, out inventio veritatis: ut in ea\nquisque proficiat — “inquisition or discovery of truth so that somebody may profit\nfrom it” (De chitate Dei xix. 19). But this difference is hardly more than the\ndifference between a Christian thinker formed by Greek, and another by Roman,\nphilosophy.\n\n85. The Gospels are concerned with the evil of earthly possessions, not with\nthe praise of labor or laborers (see esp. Matt. 6 ; 19-32, 19 : 21-24; Mark 4:19;\nLuke 6 : 20-34, 18:22-25; Acts 4: 32-35).\n\n[ ns ]\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nthe dying ancient world. No matter how articulate and how con-\nscious the thinkers of modernity were in their attacks on tradition,\nthe priority of life over everything else had acquired for them the\nstatus of a “self-evident truth,” and as such it has survived even in\nour present world, which has begun already to leave the whole\nmodern age behind and to substitute for a laboring society the so-\nciety of jobholders. But while it is quite conceivable that the devel-\nopment following upon the discovery of the Archimedean point\nwould have taken an altogether different direction if it had taken\nplace seventeen hundred years earlier, when not life but the world\nwas still the highest good of man, it by no means follows that we\nstill live in a Christian world. For what matters today is not the\nimmortality of life, but that life is the highest good. And while this\nassumption certainly is Christian in origin, it constitutes no more\nthan an important attending circumstance for the Christian faith.\nMoreover, even if we disregard the details of Christian dogma and\nconsider only the general mood of Christianity, which resides in\nthe importance of faith, it is obvious that nothing could be more\ndetrimental to this spirit than the spirit of distrust and suspicion of\nthe modern age. Surely, Cartesian doubt has proved its efficiency\nnowhere more disastrously and irretrievably than in the realm of\nreligious belief, where it was introduced by Pascal and Kierke-\ngaard, the two greatest religious thinkers of modernity. (For what\nundermined the Christian faith was not the atheism of the eight-\neenth century or the materialism of the nineteenth — their argu-\nments are frequently vulgar and, for the most part, easily refutable\nby traditional theology — but rather the doubting concern with sal-\nvation of genuinely religious men, in whose eyes the traditional\nChristian content and promise had become “absurd.”)\n\nJust as we do not know what would have happened if the Archi-\nmedean point had been discovered before the rise of Christianity,\nwe are in no position to ascertain what the destiny of Christianity\nwould have been if the great awakening of the Renaissance had not\nbeen interrupted by this event. Before Galileo, all paths still\nseemed to be open. If we think back to Leonardo, we may well\nimagine that a technical revolution would have overtaken the de-\nvelopment of humanity in any case. This might well have led to\nflight, the realization of one of the oldest and most persistent\n\n[ 319 }\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\ndreams of man, but it hardly would have led into the universe; it\nmight well have brought about the unification of the earth, but it\nhardly would have brought about the transformation of matter into\nenergy and the adventure into the microscopic universe. The only\nthing we can be sure of is that the coincidence of the reversal of\ndoing and contemplating with the earlier reversal of life and world\nbecame the point of departure for the whole modern development.\nOnly when the vita activa had lost its point of reference in the vita\ncontemplativa could it become active life in the full sense of the\nword; and only because this active life remained bound to life as\nits only point of reference could life as such, the laboring metabo-\nlism of man with nature, become active and unfold its entire fer-\ntility.\n",
        "Section 45. the victory of the Animal Laborans": "\nThe victory of the animal laborans would never have been complete\nhad not the process of secularization, the modern loss of faith in-\nevitably arising from Cartesian doubt, deprived individual life of\nits immortality, or at least of the certainty of immortality. Individ-\nual life again became mortal, as mortal as it had been in antiquity,\nand the world was even less stable, less permanent, and hence less\nto be relied upon than it had been during the Christian era. Modern\nman, when he lost the certainty of a world to come, was thrown\nback upon himself and not upon this world; far from believing that\nthe world might be potentially immortal, he was not even sure that\nit was real. And in so far as he was to assume that it was real in the\nuncritical and apparently unbothered optimism of a steadily pro-\ngressing science, he had removed himself from the earth to a much\nmore distant point than any Christian otherworldliness had ever\nremoved him. Whatever the word “secular” is meant to signify in\ncurrent usage, historically it cannot possibly be equated with\nworldliness; modern man at any rate did not gain this world when\nhe lost the other world, and he did not gain life, strictly speaking,\neither; he was thrust back upon it, thrown into the closed inward-\nness of introspection, where the highest he could experience were\nthe empty processes of reckoning of the mind, its play with itself.\nThe only contents left were appetites and desires, the senseless\n\n[ 320 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nurges of his body which he mistook for passion and which he\ndeemed to be “unreasonable” because he found he could not “rea-\nson,” that is, not reckon with them. The only thing that could now\nbe potentially immortal, as immortal as the body politic in antiq-\nuity and as individual life during the Middle Ages, was life itself,\nthat is, the possibly everlasting life process of the species man-\nkind.\n\nWe saw before that in the rise of society it was ultimately the\nlife of the species which asserted itself. Theoretically, the turning\npoint from the earlier modem age's insistence on the “egoistic”\nlife of the individual to its later emphasis on “social” life and\n“socialized man” (Marx) came when Marx transformed the\ncruder notion of classical economy — that all men, in so far as they\nact at all, act for reasons of self-interest — into forces of interest\nwhich inform, move, and direct the classes of society, and through\ntheir conflicts direct society as a whole. Socialized mankind is that\nstate of society where only one interest rules, and the subject of\nthis interest is either classes or man-kind, but neither man nor men.\nThe point is that now even the last trace of action in what men\nwere doing, the motive implied in self-interest, disappeared. What\nwas left was a “natural force,” the force of the life process itself,\nto which all men and all human activities were equally submitted\n(“the thought process itself is a natural process”) S6 and whose only\naim, if it had an aim at all, was survival of the animal species man.\nNone of the higher capacities of man was any longer necessary to\nconnect individual life with the life of the species; individual life\nbecame part of the life process, and to labor, to assure the con-\ntinuity of one's own life and the life of his family, was all that was\nneeded. What was not needed, not necessitated by life's metabo-\nlism with nature, was either superfluous or could be justified only\nin terms of a peculiarity of human as distinguished from other\nanimal life-— so that Milton was considered to have written his\nParadise Lost for the same reasons and out of similar urges that\ncompel the silkworm to produce silk.\n\nIf we compare the modern world with that of the past, the loss ot\nhuman experience involved in this development is extraordinarily\nstriking. It is not only and not even primarily contemplation which\n\n86. In a letter Marx wrote to Kugelmann in July, 1868.\n\n[ 321 ]\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nhas become an entirely meaningless experience. Thought itself,\nwhen it became “reckoning with consequences,” became a func-\ntion of the brain, with the result that electronic instruments are\nfound to fulfil these functions much better than we ever could.\nAction was soon and still is almost exclusively understood in terms\nof making and fabricating, only that making, because of its world-\nliness and inherent indifference to life, was now regarded as but\nanother form of laboring, a more complicated but not a more\nmysterious function of the life process.\n\nMeanwhile, we have proved ingenious enough to find ways to\nease the toil and trouble of living to the point where an elimination\nof laboring from the range of human activities can no longer be\nregarded as utopian. For even now, laboring is too lofty, too am-\nbitious a word for what we are doing, or think we are doing, in the\nworld we have come to live in. The last stage of the laboring so-\nciety, the society of jobholders, demands of its members a sheer\nautomatic functioning, as though individual life had actually been\nsubmerged in the over-all life process of the species and the only\nactive decision still required of the individual were to let go, so to\nspeak, to abandon his individuality, the still individually sensed\npain and trouble of living, and acquiesce in a dazed, “tranquil-\nized,” functional type of behavior. The trouble with modern the-\nories of behaviorism is not that they are wrong but that they could\nbecome true, that they actually are the best possible conceptualiza-\ntion of certain obvious trends in modern society. It is quite con-\nceivable that the modern age — which began with such an unprece-\ndented and promising outburst of human activity — may end in the\ndeadliest, most sterile passivity history has ever known.\n\nBut there are other more serious danger signs that man may be\nwilling and, indeed, is on the point of developing into that animal\nspecies from which, since Darwin, he imagines he has come. If, in\nconcluding, we return once more to the discovery of the Archime-\ndean point and apply it, as Kafka warned us not to do, to man him-\nself and to what he is doing on this earth, it at once becomes mani-\nfest that all his activities, watched from a sufficiently removed\nvantage point in the universe, would appear not as activities of any\nkind but as processes, so that, as a scientist recently put it, modem\nmotorization would appear like a process of biological mutation in\n\n[ 322 ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nwhich human bodies gradually begin to be covered by shells of\nsteel. For the watcher from the universe, this mutation would be no\nmore or less mysterious than the mutation which now goes on\nbefore our eyes in those small living organisms which we fought\nwith antibiotics and which mysteriously have developed new\nstrains to resist us. How deep-rooted this usage of the Archime-\ndean point against ourselves is can be seen in the very metaphors\nwhich dominate scientific thought today. The reason why scien-\ntists can tell us about the “life” in the atom— where apparently\nevery particle is “free” to behave as it wants and the laws ruling\nthese movements are the same statistical laws which, according to\nthe social scientists, rule human behavior and make the multitude\nbehave as it must, no matter how “free” the individual particle\nmay appear to be in its choices— the reason, in other words, why\nthe behavior of the infinitely small particle is not only similar in\npattern to the planetary system as it appears to us but resembles the\nlife and behavior patterns in human society is, of course, that we\nlook and live in this society as though we were as far removed\nfrom our own human existence as we are from the infinitely small\nand the immensely large which, even if they could be perceived by\nthe finest instruments, are too far away from us to be experienced.\n\nNeedless to say, this does not mean that modern man has lost his\ncapacities or is on the point of losing them. No matter what sociol-\nogy, psychology, and anthropology will tell us about the “social\nanimal,” men persist in making, fabricating, and building, although\nthese faculties are more and more restricted to the abilities of the\nartist, so that the concomitant experiences of worldliness escape\nmore and more the range of ordinary human experience . 87\n\nSimilarly, the capacity for action, at least in the sense of the\nreleasing of processes, is still with us, although it has become the\nexclusive prerogative of the scientists, who have enlarged the\n\n87. This inherent worldliness of the artist is of course not changed if a “non-\nobjective art” replaces the representation of things; to mistake this “non-objec-\ntivity” for subjectivity, where the artist feels called upon to “express himself,”\nhis subjective feelings, is the mark of charlatans, not of artists. The artist, whether\npainter or sculptor or poet or musician, produces worldly objects, and his reifica-\ntion has nothing in common with the highly questionable and, at any rate, wholly\nunartistic practice of expression. Expressionist art, but not abstract art, is a con-\ntradiction in terms.\n\n\n[ 325 ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n\nrealm of human affairs to the point of extinguishing the time-\nhonored protective dividing line between nature and the human\nworld. In view of such achievements, performed for centuries in\nthe unseen quiet of the laboratories, it seems only proper that their\ndeeds should eventually have turned out to have greater news\nvalue, to be of greater political significance, than the administrative\nand diplomatic doings of most so-called statesmen. It certainly is\nnot without irony that those whom public opinion has persistently\nheld to be the least practical and the least political members of\nsociety should have turned out to be the only ones left who still\nknow how to act and how to act in concert. For their early organi-\nzations, which they founded in the seventeenth century for the\nconquest of nature and in which they developed their own moral\nstandards and their own code of honor, have not only survived all\nvicissitudes of the modern age, but they have become one of the\nmost potent power-generating groups in all history. But the action\nof the scientists, since it acts into nature from the standpoint of the\nuniverse and not into the web of human relationships, lacks the\nrevelatory character of action as well as the ability to produce\nstories and become historical, which together form the very source\nfrom which meaningfulness springs into and illuminates human ex-\nistence. In this existentially most important aspect, action, too, has\nbecome an experience for the privileged few, and these few who\nstill know what it means to act may well be even fewer than the\nartists, their experience even rarer than the genuine experience of\nand love for the world.\n\nThought, finally — which we, following the premodern as well\nas the modern tradition, omitted from our reconsideration of the\nvita activa — is still possible, and no doubt actual, wherever men\nlive under the conditions of political freedom. Unfortunately, and\ncontrary to what is currently assumed about the proverbial ivory-\ntower independence of thinkers, no other human capacity is so\nvulnerable, and it is in fact far easier to act under conditions of\ntyranny than it is to think. As a living experience, thought has al-\nways been assumed, perhaps wrongly, to be known only to the\nfew. It may not be presumptuous to believe that these few have\nnot become fewer in our time. This may be irrelevant, or of re-\nstricted relevance, for the future of the world; it is not irrelevant\n\nr K* ]\n\n\n\nThe Vita Activa and the Modern Age\n\nfor the future of man. For if no other test but the experience of\nbeing active, no other measure but the extent of sheer activity were\nto be applied to the various activities within the vita activa , it might\nwell be that thinking as such would surpass them all. Whoever has\nany experience in this matter will know how right Cato was when\nhe said: Numquam se plus agere quam nihil cum ageret , numquam\nminus solum esse quam cum solus esset — “Never is he more active\nthan when he does nothing, never is he less alone than when he is\nby himself.”\n\n\n[ 325 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Section 46. Acknowledgments": "\n\nThe present study owes its origin to a series of lectures, deliv-\nered under the auspices of the Charles R. Walgreen Foundation in\nApril, 1956, at the University of Chicago, under the title, “Vita\nActiva.” In the initial stages of this work, which goes back to the\nearly fifties, I was given a grant by the Simon Guggenheim Me-\nmorial Foundation, and in the last stage I was greatly helped by a\ngrant from the Rockefeller Foundation. In the fall of 1953, the\nChristian Gauss Seminar in Criticism of Princeton University of-\nfered me the opportunity to present some of my ideas in a series of\nlectures under the title “Karl Marx and the Tradition of Political\nThought.” I am still grateful for the patience and encouragement\nwith which these first attempts were received and for the lively\nexchange of ideas with writers from here and abroad for which the\nSeminar, unique in this respect, provides a sounding board.\n\nRose Feitelson, who has helped me ever since I began to publish\nin this country, was again of great assistance in the preparation of\nmanuscript and index. If I had to be grateful for what she has done\nover a period of twelve years, I would be altogether helpless.\n\nHannah Arendt\n\n\n[ 527 ]\n\n\n\nPublisher's Note:\n\n\nIn preparation of this second edition, we have corrected sev-\neral minor typographical errors. The observant reader may no-\ntice, however, that the Greek letter chi has been transliterated as\nkh in some instances and as the more standard ch in others.
